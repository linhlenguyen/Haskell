<H1><CENTER> A Taxonomy of meta-programming systems.</CENTER>
</H1>

In a meta-programming system meta-programs manipulate object-programs.
Meta-programs may construct object-programs, combine object-program
fragments into larger object-programs, observe the structure and other
properties of object-programs, and execute object-programs to obtain
their values.
<p>

There are two important kind of meta-programming scenarios:
program generators, and program analyses. Each of these
scenarios has a number of distinguishing characteristics

        <LI> Typed <U>vs.</U> un-Typed
     </OL>

</OL>

<H2>Generators <U>vs.</U> Analyses</H2>

A program generator (a meta-program) solves a particular problem by constructing
another program (an object-program) that solves the problem at hand. Usually
the generated (object) program is "specialized" for the particular problem
and uses less resources than a general purpose, non-generator solution.
<p>
A program analysis (a meta-program) observes the structure and environment of an object-program and computes some value as a result. Results can be data- or control-flow graphs, or even another object-program with properties based on the properties of the source object-program. Examples of these kind of meta-systems are: program transformers, optimizers, and partial evaluation systems.

<H3>Representation: Strings <U>vs.</U> Algebraic datatype <U>vs.</U> Quasi-quote</H3>
A meta-programming system uses program annotations (called staging annotations)
to distinguish between the meta-program from the object program. An object
program should be a first-class value. One should think of it as a datastructure
that can be manipulated like any other. Many meta-systems represent object-programs by using strings, graphs, or algebraic data-structures.
<p>
With the string encoding, we represent the code fragment <CODE>f (x,y)</CODE> simply as <CODE>"f(x,y)"</CODE>.  While constructing and combining fragments represented by strings can be done concisely, deconstructing them is quite verbose.  More seriously, there is no <EM>automatically verifiable</EM> guarantee that programs thusly constructed are syntactically correct.  For example, <CODE>"f (,y)"</CODE> can have the static type string, but this clearly does <EM>not</EM> imply that this string represents a syntactically correct program.

<p>
With the datatype encoding, we can address the syntactic correctness
problem. A datatype encoding is essentially the same as what is called <EM>abstract syntax</EM> or <EM>parse trees</EM>.  The encoding of the fragment
<CODE>"f(x,y)"</CODE> in an SML datatype might be:
<CODE>Apply(Variable "f",Tuple [Variable "x" ,Variable "y"])</CODE>
using a datatype declared as follows:
<CODE><PRE>
datatype exp = Variable of string
             | Apply of (exp * exp)
             | Tuple of exp list
</PRE></CODE>
<p>
Using a datatype encoding has an immediate benefit: <EM>correct
typing</EM> for the meta-program ensures <EM>correct syntax</EM> for all
object-programs.  Because SML supports pattern matching over
datatypes, deconstructing programs becomes easier than with the string
representation.  However, constructing programs is now more verbose
because we must use the cumbersome constructors like <CODE>Variable</CODE>,
<CODE>Apply</CODE>, and <CODE>Tuple</CODE>.
<p>
The Quasi-quote representation is an attempt to over come this limitation.
Here the actual representation of object-code is hidden from the user
by the means of a quotation mechanism. Object code is constructed
by placing "quotation" annotations around normal code fragments.
<p>
In the remainder of this document we will use the quasi-quotation notation of the MetaML meta-programming system. In MetaML quasi-quotation is just one of several staging annotations. In MetaML the staging annotations are Brackets
<CODE>&lt; &gt;</CODE>, Escape <CODE>~</CODE>,  <CODE>lift</CODE>, and <CODE>run</CODE>.  An expression <CODE>&lt; e &gt;</CODE>  builds the code representation of <CODE>e</CODE>; <CODE>~ e</CODE>  splices the code obtained by evaluating <CODE>e</CODE> into the body of a surrounding Bracketed expression; and <CODE>run e</CODE> evaluates <CODE>e</CODE> to obtain a piece of code, and then evaluates this piece of code.  It is important to note that <CODE>~ e</CODE> is only legal within lexically enclosing Brackets.
<p>
As with the datatype representation of programs, using staging
annotations guarantees the the syntactic correctness of object programs
using the the type correctness of the meta-programs, but maintains
the ease of construction of object-programs.
With a staged type system (see below) the type correctness of meta-programs
can also guarantee the type correctness (as well as the syntactic correctness)
of object programs.

<H3>Automatic <U>vs.</U> Manual</H3>

We call a meta-programming system where the programmer places the staging annotations directly a manual staging system. If the staging annotations
are place by an automatic process, then the meta-programming system
is an automatic staging system.
<p>
Off-line partial evaluation is an automatic staging meta-system. Consider
the simple partial evaluation function <CODE>PE</CODE> with type
<CODE>&lt; s -&gt; d -&gt; a &gt; -&gt; (s -&gt; &lt;d -&gt; a&gt;)</CODE>
<p>
PE takes the representation of a program with one static parameter and
one dynamic parameter and returns an answer. It analyses this program
and automatically produces a annotated program which when given
the static parameter as input produces a representation of the
function from dynamic parameter to answer. For example:
<p>
<CODE>PE &lt;fn s =&gt; fn d =&gt; d + (s + 3)&gt;</CODE>
<p>
evaluates to
<p>
<CODE>fn s => &lt;fn d =&gt; d + ~(lift (s+3))&gt;</CODE>
<p>
Automatic meta-programming systems save the user the bother of placing
the annotations, but the user of an automatic system loses control
over the structure of the output.
<p>
It has been argued that manually staged programs are hard to write,
and are much larger than their un-staged counterparts that could be
input into a PE system, thus saving the user a lot of work. With the
advent of modern meta-programming systems with quasi-quote staging annotations
it remains to be seen if this argument still holds. Our experience
has been that manually annotated programs are (within a few percent)
the same size as their unstaged counterparts.

<H3>Static Generator <U>vs.</U> Runtime Generator</H3>

Program generators come in two flavors: static generators, which generate code which is then “written to disk” and processed by normal compilers etc. and run-time code generators which are programs that write or construct other programs, and then immediately execute the programs they have generated. Examples of program generators are run-time code generation systems like the Synthesis Kernel, and static program generators such as Yacc.

<H3>Homogeneous <U>vs.</U> Heterogeneous</H3>

There are two kinds of meta-programming systems: homogeneous systems
where the meta-language and the object language are the same, and
heterogeneous systems where the meta-language is different from the
object-language.
<p>
Both kinds of systems are useful for representing programs for automated program analysis and manipulation. But there are important advantages to homogeneous systems. Only homogeneous systems can be multi-level, where an object-program can itself be a meta-program that manipulates second-level object-programs. Only in a homogeneous meta-system can a single type system type both the meta-language and the object-language. Only homogeneous meta-systems can support reflection (where the meta-language is rich enough that every primitive on object-programs can be expressed as a meta-program). Only homogeneous meta-systems can support a "run" or "eval" operation in a uniform way. This is what makes run-time code generation possible. Homogeneous systems also have the important pedagogical and usability property that the user need only learn a single language.

<H3>Typed <U>vs.</U> un-Typed</H3>

To automate the meta-programming process and to make it less error prone,
it must be possible to statically infer some properties of the object programs
from the meta-programs that manipulate them. An important advance
provided by the meta-programming system MetaML is a staged type system.
A staged type system combines the important meta-programming information
of staging and types into one system.
<p>
A staged type system states precisely the staging constraints of the system, as well as the typing requirements of each stage. One advantage of a staged type system is that meta-programs that manipulate ill-typed object-programs are themselves ill-typed. This provides great feedback to the writers of meta-programs.
<p>
Staged type systems are particularly appropriate for homogeneous
systems, because only a single type system is necessary. Such systems
capture the static versus dynamic parameter distinction of partial evaluation. Thus a program f with type:
    <BIG><CODE>f :: a -&gt; &lt;d&gt; -&gt; &lt; b -&gt; &lt;c&gt; &gt;</CODE></BIG>
tells us quite a bit about the program.
<p>
It says that f is a function with two parameters. the first is a static (known now) parameter of type "a", and the second is dynamic (not known until the second stage) parameter of type "d". This program produces an object program, which is also a (second-level) meta-program, with a single (second-stage) static parameter of type "b" which produces a (third-stage) object program of type "c".
<p>
Typed heterogeneous meta-systems are also important. Here the type of the meta-program somehow incorporates the types of the object language. This allows meta-programs to encode only type-consistent (at the object-level) transformations of object code, or type consistent translations from one object-language to another. In this case there are three type systems which must work harmoniously (the meta-level types system, and the two object-level type systems).

<H4>Statically Typed <U>vs.</U> Dynamically Typed </H4>


<H3>Two-stage <U>vs.</U> N-stage</H3>

A two-stage meta-programming system allows only a single meta-stage, and
a single object-stage. In an N-stage meta-programming system any
object-program can also be a meta-program.




<H2>Human-Machine Interface</H2>

In addition to these operational properties, a meta-system should also
have a good human-system interface. Our experience with
meta-programming systems has led us to formulate the following
high-level meta-programming human-system interface <EM>desiderata</EM>:

<OL>
<LI> <B>Construction.</B> It should be easy to construct code using
some sort of pattern-based object-code templates. Templates should
“look like” the object language they represent.

<LI> <B> Splicing.</B> Program fragments should be easy to combine into
larger program fragments, this is best accomplished by a
parameterizable splicing mechanism such as a ``template-with-holes".

<LI> <B> Typing.</B> In a homogeneous system, object-code has a
parametric  type, i.e., there is code with type Int, code with type
Float, etc. Type correctness of the meta-program, should guarantee
type correctness of the object-programs it constructs.

<LI> <B> Hygiene.</B> Bound variables in templates should be handled in
some sophisticated way which guarantees no name clashes, and which
obeys the rules of static scoping. Free variables in program templates
should refer to the value of the variable at the static location where
the template is defined, not where it is eventually executed.

<LI> <B> Run.</B> Object-programs can be run. Generated code can be
“tested” inside the meta-system.

<LI> <B> Printing.</B> Object-programs can be printed. This is
essential for debugging of meta-programs. The object-programs should
be pretty-printed in the manner in which they are normally written by
a programmer. They should not be represented by some abstract
representation unfamiliar to the programmer.

<LI> <B> Observation.</B> Object-programs have structure. It should be
possible to analyze object-programs, take them apart, etc.
