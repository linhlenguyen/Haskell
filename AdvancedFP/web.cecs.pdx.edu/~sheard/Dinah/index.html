My dog, Dinah, died yesterday. She was a good dog. She was a beautiful
dog. I lost count of the number of times strangers would stop us as we
walked in the park and say "What a beautiful dog". She was a classic German
Shepherd. She was black with tan legs. She had enormous pointy ears
that she used like radar. She had reddish brown splotches behind her ears
and tan spots above her eyes that looked just like eye brows. When she was
young, her face was all black, but as she got older her chin became
speckled with gray. She had big paws, that she didn't like anyone to touch,
and a long fluffy tail. A really long tail. So long, that when she stood
still, her tail dragged on the ground. On her back, just behind her
shoulders she had a small white ruff. The only white on her back. The white
hairs (and only the white hairs) stood up when she was alerted.
<p>

We got Dinah as a puppy, for my son Caleb's 10th birthday. I wasn't sure I
wanted a dog, and all the responsibility that went with it. We were moving
that summer, and my wife, Barbara, insisted we get the boy something to
hold onto. Dinah was the cutest little puppy with over sized paws. She was
so young that one of her ears couldn't stand up on its own. I slowly
became Dinah's caregiver. I walked her, I fed her, I cleaned up after her,
I fell in love.
<p>
I walked Dinah almost every morning. We'd walk from our house down to
Jenkins's Estate Park. Amongst the rhododendrons, around the roses, across
the fish pond bridge, down the primrose path, under the two redwood trees,
and through the tiny bit of old growth forest that was never logged right
in the middle of Beaverton. As far as Dinah was concerned, it was her park.
She never minded the early morning maintenance workers. She knew they
belonged. Many of them knew

her name, and would stop and pet her. But
strangers, especially strangers with dogs, that was another matter. Many a
poor dog walker got a stiff scolding from Dinah before she'd finally relent
and share her park. I figure we made that walk close to two thousand times
in Dinah's ten and a half years. At an average of 1.5 miles a loop, I
figure Dinah and I walked across the continental United States, 1 day at a
time. Not a bad journey for a "Dad" and his dog.

<p>
Dinah was never happier than when we walked in the park. In the last year
or so I could see she was slowing down. I told her the walk was as much for
me as it was for her. I needed the exercise. She didn't seem to mind. I
thought she might have a touch of arthritis, she was 10 after all, a grand
old lady. She'd muster up the strength, and by the time we got ready to
turn back, you could see she was back to her old self. We took the walk
for the last time on Monday, 1 week before she died. I knew something
was wrong. It was that walk that made me take her to the vet.
I took the same walk this morning alone. I don't know if I can do it again.
<p>
She was a great dog. She and the boy grew up together. From fluffy puppy &
rosy cheeked boy, to 75 pounds of guard dog & 6 feet 5 inches of
incredible young man. If I was Dinah's caretaker, Caleb was Dinah's soul
mate. He could get her to do anything, Sit, Shake, Lie down, Speak,
Rollover, Crawl, Cry.  He'd rile her up, she'd jump and bark and chase him
around the house. Even last summer, Caleb could get Dinah to act
like a puppy again. When she was young, Caleb would chase her down the
hallway, corner her at the end, and then he'd lie flat on the ground.
Dinah, would charge down the hallway leaping three feet in the air over the
prone boy, and the chase would begin all over again. She loved her boy.
<p>
She loved everyone. Our home was teenage central. There was always a half
dozen or more of Caleb's friends at our house. They'd congregate in the
garage and Dinah would let everyone know, long before they got to the front
door, that someone new had arrived. She'd sniff, approve, and take one more
young person under her protection. She'd lounge on the floor, with her ears
alert, watching everything with those deep brown eyes that missed nothing.
No one ever left without saying goodbye to Dinah, scratching her ears,
telling her she was a good dog.

We have a summer home in upstate New York. It is the true home of my heart.
I try to spend a month there every summer. I haven't missed a summer visit
to the lake in 51 years. When Dinah was young I'd hire dog sitters to watch
the house when we were gone. Bill, Walid, Emir, Nathan, Willy, Ingemar,
Chris, Brad. Students of mine, neighbors, friends of Caleb's. Dinah
remembered all of them. Even after years, she'd get excited when one came
to visit. The last three summers, I took Dinah with me to the lake. Dinah
was in her element at the lake. She didn't like the water, but she sit on
the dock and watch everything in that way of hers. A group of Caleb's
friends have come to the lake the last few summers. 9 last summer, 13 the
year before. For her it was like reunion, all those young people she knew
and loved. She'd crawl up on the couch and squeeze between Caleb and
whoever was in her way, and lay her head on his lap.
<p>
She climbed three mountains at the lake last summer. At home Dinah was
never outside off leash, but in the Adirondack Mountains, twenty miles from
the nearest town, she'd run free. From the head of the climbing group, back
to the tail, she'd guide us along. I guess she wasn't a shepherd for
nothing. I think, Dinah with her head on Caleb's lap, or Dinah surveying
her world from the top of the mountains, is the way I will always remember
her.
<p>
Caleb is 20 now, a Junior in college. Because my wife travels alot,
in the last two years, I have often been home alone with just Dinah for a
companion. She would follow me around the house, she would sleep at the
foot of my bed, and she'd pick up her leash in her mouth when she wanted to
go for a walk. She would never fail to greet me when I arrived home. She
never whined, barked without reason, begged, stole food off the table, or
chewed anything (well, maybe a greasy napkin or two if she could sneak
one). She was there when you needed a hug, and she never complained. She
was a good dog, a great dog.
<p>

When Dinah was young, when I first started taking her on daily early
morning walks, I would talk to her. I told her that everyone had a job, and
that her job was to love her family, to guard the boy, and to keep him
safe, to see that he grew into a fine young man. Dinah, in case you never
heard me when I told you, I loved you. Your performance far exceeded
the expectations of your job description. You lived with unmatched love and
devotion to your family. I will miss you.
