<p>
A few years ago I started to track my academic genealogy. I did this because my <A HREF="http://www.dna.caltech.edu/~pwkr/">nephew</A>
showed we how his <A HREF="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/">mathematics genealogy</A> could be traced all the way back to
<A HREF="http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=137705">Leibniz</A>, and as a sort of tribute to my
Ph.D. advisor (<A HREF="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~stemple/">Dave Stemple</A>) who, at the time, was quite ill, and who died a short time later. I wanted him to know how much influence he has
on me, and through all his students, the world.

<p>
Anyway, its taken me a while to acculumate
all this information, and I thought some of my friends and advisees might like to see it. It came as a great surprise
to me who was on my genealogy. Have fun looking it over and following the links, I had fun making it.
