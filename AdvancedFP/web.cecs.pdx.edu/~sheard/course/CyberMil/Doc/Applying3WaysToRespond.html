These responses were given by one of your classmates when
answering the <A HREF="BookReviewCritics.html">Singularity is Near criticism worksheet</A>.
<p>
Over all I think the responses
are excellent in that they get right to the point, and use evidence to back
up their claims. Some of the claims
are a bit terse, can we use the <A HREF="3WaysToRespond.html">3 Ways to Respond templates</A> to
improve them?
<p>
For each objection, rephrase the objection to use one of the templates we discussed
earlier.

<p>
<ul>

<li> The author fears death; he says the singularity may occur as early as 2045
	but he may just be saying that because he want to experience the
	singularity---Chapter 7 Kurzweil does not respond to this criticism in
	Chapter 9. This leads me to agree with the critic over Kurzweil.
	<br> <BR><br> <BR> <br> <BR> <br> <BR>

<li> Doesn’t address how memory is stored in the brain---Chapter 3 This criticism
	is partially addressed in the response to "criticism from the complexity of
	neural processing", however the response is only partial and overall
	unsatisfactory which leads me to agree with the critic again.
	<br> <BR><br> <BR> <br> <BR> <br> <BR>


<li> The author fails to address the differences in economic status, he
	apparently forgets that not "everyone everywhere [is] from the upper quarter
	of income earners in Silcon Valley" ---Chapter 5 This criticism is completely
	shot down by Kurzweil on the bottom of page 430, Kurzweil answers that
	"because of the ongoing exponential growth of price performance, all these
	technologies quickly become so inexpensive as to become almost free".

Take one of your own objections and rewrite it using the templates
