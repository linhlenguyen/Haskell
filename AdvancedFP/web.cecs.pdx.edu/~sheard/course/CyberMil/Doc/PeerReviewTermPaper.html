<p>
First study the grading rubric for the Spring term paper.
<ol>
<LI> A title and author, and appropriate length (5-6 pages)
<LI> A good thesis paragraph. Not too broad, a little controversial, clear and unambiguous.
I should know exactly what your thesis is by the end of the first paragraph. If I have to guess
what your thesis is you will lose points.
<li> At least 3 graphical representations of data. The graphs should be appropriately sized, too big (wasting space) or too little (hard to read) will be penalized.
<li> Graphs should be labelled and have good captions.
<li> The meaning of the graphs should be discussed in the text.
<LI> Sections and paragraphs that clearly support the thesis.
<LI> Sections and paragraphs that anticipate arguments against the thesis.
<LI> Good use of quotes
<LI> A bibliography in MLA style.
<LI> Correct spelling, punctuation, grammar.
<LI> Original and interesting to read
</ol>
<p>
For each part of the rubric, either
<ul>
<li> Find a part of the paper that satisfies the rubric. Draw a box around it and label it with the rubric number.
<li> Write a note on the back of the paper saying "I couldn't find trext that related to rubric part X".
</ul>

<p>
List the 3 best things about the paper. Be specific, tell why you found these things useful.
