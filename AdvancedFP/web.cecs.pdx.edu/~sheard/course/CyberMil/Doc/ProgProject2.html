In this homework we are asking you to do something creative
with the music (Haskore) packages.

<p>
You will need to download and install the correct libraries

<ul>
<li> To create music, get and install the Haskore Libraries
	<ol>
	 <li> For Hugs, download and unzip the <A HREF="../Code/Haskore.zip">directory</A>, and drop into the packages directory of the Hugs installation.
	      On my machine that is found at C:\Program Files\WinHugs\packages\ .
	      Here is a <A HREF="DirectoryStructureOfHaskoreInstall.jpg">screen-shot</A> of what the directory structure
	      should look like.
	 </ol>
</ul>

<p>
By "creative" I expect you to create some aesthetic music artifact.
If you know something about music, feel free to create your own composition. If you
don't transcribing some piece of music from sheet music is also acceptable.
You can use music from a book, or something you find on the web.
<p>
You might want to use the following documents as resources.
<ul>
<li> The <A HREF="TranscribeMusic.png">key</A> that relates notes in Haskore to the G clef.
<li> Some example illustrating <A HREF="SampleMusicCode.html">the different approaches</A> putting music together using :+:, line, or line2
<li> The mentor session <A HREF="../Code/Wk09Music.hs">worksheet</A> we used on April 22, 2009.
<li> Notes from <A HREF="../Code/LectureMusic.hs">the class lecture</A> on April 22, 2009.
<li> The official <A HREF="http://haskell.org/haskore/onlinetutorial/index.html">Haskore Tutorial</A>.
<li> A project 2 <A HREF="../Code/Project2Template.hs">stub</A> to get you started.
</ul>
<p>
No matter what you do. try and put your own twist on your music. I will grade it using the following rubric
<p>
<ul>
<li> Is the source a well structured program?
<li> Is the result aesthetically pleasing? Does it sound good?
<li> Does the program exercise the full spectrum of possibilities
explained in the lectures (uses many, if not all, of the operators rather than just 1 or 2).
<li> Has the author added some thing new?
  <ol>
    <li> For example, you might use the NoteAtrributes to control
         loudness, or define operators to fade in and out, or
         operators to dynamically shift from one key to another, or to repeat a phase several times.
   </ol>
<li> You use small functions to capture repeated patterns. The triplet function
from <A HREF="../Code/LectureMusic.hs">the class lecture</A>, is an example
of this.
<li> Is the code well documented. That is you use comments
<ol> <li> -- Any line starting with two dashes starts a comment
     <li> {- any line nested between open-squiggol-dash and close-squiggol-dash is a comment -}
     </ol>
to explain what you are doing. I will look for comments in your solution, and evaluate if they
explain things well.
<li> If the student is called upon in class, can the student explain
  how his program works?

</ul>
<p>
Good Luck!, I am looking forward to the results!
