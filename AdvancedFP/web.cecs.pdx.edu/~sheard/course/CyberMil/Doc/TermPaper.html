of the data from the Prior Learning Survey, our study of Census data, etc.

<p><A name="5min">
<H1>Five Minute Presentation</H1>
<p> You will prepare and deliver a 5 minute presentation starting on Wednesday, May 13.
<p> <B>Powerpoint must be in my mailbox by 11:00 am</B>, Wednesday, May 13, <B>or you will get a zero</B> for the assignment.
<p> The presentation is a sort of proposal about what you want to write about.
It should discuss the topic and the methods you will use in the paper. It need
not be a complete argument.
<p> The 5 minute presentation is designed to give each student
the opportunity to prepare and deliver a short oral presentation.
The purpose of the presentaion is three fold: (1)
to give each student the opportunity to practice their speaking skills,
(2) to help motivate the each student to identifiy and organize
the topics around which they will write their term paper,
(3) to get feedback from the professor and class about their ideas.

<UL>
<LI> Identify a topic for your paper. Here are some ideas:
<UL>
<LI> Investigate one or two of the data points about exponential growth
discussed in "The Singularity is Near".
<LI> Discuss how the Freshman Class that entered PSU in 2008 is (or is not) like
another cohort of people by using data from the Prior Learning Survey and other
published data sources.
<LI> Find a court case that adresses equal opportunity in the work place for your topic. Use data
to describe the case and how it was adjudicated.
<LI> Find some <A HREF="http://www.census.gov/eeo2000/">census data</A> that describes
some glaring inequality in the work place, and use the data formatted in graphs
and tables to argue your case.
</UL>
<LI> Prepare a 5 minute oral presentation of 3-4 powerpoint slides.
<LI> Present it to the class.
<LI> Answer questions, and get feedback.
</ul>

<p>
Grading Rubric. When grading the presentation I will look for the
following information in your presentation.
<UL>
<LI> The thesis of your paper
<LI> The kinds of data you would like to use.
<li> Several possible sources for that data.
<li> Possible ways to display that data visually.
<LI> How you will frame your argument based upon the data.
<LI> What kind of conclusions are you hoping to demonstrate.
</UL>
<p>

I will also look for the following attributes of the presentation.
<UL>
<LI> It fits withing the given time (<B>5 minutes</B>).
<LI> It lists sources for your ideas and data (I.e. it contains some information along the lines
of an annotated bibliography).
<LI> Use graphs, pictures, visuals to illustrate your ideas. I.e. it might display
a graph that illustrates how you want to display your data, even before you have found
your data.
<LI> Gives evidence (support your claims)
<LI> Connects your topic to something we have studied in class.
<LI> Tells a story
</UL>

Some guidlines for Presentation preparation.

<UL>
<LI> A presentation is a tool that helps you explain to others what you have done.
Most of the information is in your comments. The presentation gives you something to refer to, and reminds you of important points.
<LI>Keep visuals simple and uncluttered
<LI> When using words, restrict text to 4-8 lines per page.
<LI>Use color and font changes to carry a message (e.g. related concepts or experimental results in the same colors), not arbitrarily.
<LI>Use LARGE fonts.
<LI>Use graphics rather than words where possible.
<LI>Put keywords on slides to help you remember what to say.
</UL>
Sign up for a <A HREF="PresentationSignUpSheet.html">presentation slot</A> in Mentor Session on Wednesday May 6.
<p><A name="draft1">
<H1>First Draft</H1>

You are to hand in a first draft in class on Wednesday, May 20.
<p>
You will bring 3 hard copies to class that day. One for Professor Sheard, and two to use
in a peer review exercise in mentor session. <B>Failure to bring 3 hard copies
to class at 12:30 will get a zero on this part of the assignment.</B>
<p>
Although it is not required for you to hand in the following, you might want
to create the intermediate documents as you prepare the rough draft.
<UL>
<LI> Annotated Bibliography, with citations, synopsis, and apt quotes.
<LI> Thesis paragraph.
<LI> Paper outline.
</UL>

<p>
<B>Writing Center:</B>  I strongly recommend making at least one appointment with the
writing center NOW.  It is best to meet with them when you have a clearly
defined topic and at least some preliminary writing.  If you wait until the end
of spring term you will not get an appointment.  It would be appropriate to
have three or more appointments if writing is a challenge for you.  Even
someone who already writes well can benefit from an expert opinion.

<p>
<B>Library:</B>  Don’t be shy about asking for help in the library.  Also see the
<A HREF="http://www.lib.pdx.edu/instruction/survivalguide/index.htm">Research Survival Guide</A>.
.
<p>
<B>Consultation Sessions.</B> I will hand out a sign up sheet, and you may make a 15 minute appointment to
discuss your rough draft on Tuesday (May 26), or Wednesday (May 27) with Professor Sheard. A consulation
session is not required, but I offer it as an opportunity.

<LI> 5 points. A title and author, and appropriate length (5-6 pages)
<LI> 5 points. A good thesis paragraph. Not too broad, a little controversial, clear and unambiguous.
I should know exactly what your thesis is by the end of the first paragraph. If I have to guess
what your thesis is you will lose points.
