<H3>The Portfolio:</H3>
<p>

A portfolio is a representative compilation of your work in your Freshman Inquiry course. It is
meant to reflect your learning throughout the year, your struggles and your successes. All
students are asked to complete a portfolio which includes a reflective essay as well as at least
eight different assignments completed during the entire year. Choose specific examples of
assignments that you feel helped you better understand each of the University Studies goals:

<ul>
<li> communication (please include an example of your writing with a first draft and a polished revision and an example of quantitative literacy),
<li> ethics and social responsibility,
<li> critical thinking,
<li> the diversity of the human experience.
</ul>
<p>
For a complete description of these goals, please see:
<A HREF="http://www.pdx.edu/unst/university-studies-goals">www.pdx.edu/unst/university-studies-goals</A>.
<p>
For all work samples, please include a copy of the original instructions from the faculty. You may
use the links from the daily record to find the original assignment document.
<p>
<H3>The Final Reflective Essay:</H3>
<p>

The purpose of this essay is to explain how the assignments you chose for the portfolio show
your learning process and progress in Freshman Inquiry.
<p>
The essay of approximately 1500 words, written in first person, must be double-spaced and
proofread.  In your essay, using specific items from your portfolio as support and examples, you
will briefly describe the elements you chose to include in your portfolio and explain how they
relate to or show the points you are making in your essay: what you have learned about each of
the four University Studies goals this year and how the assignments in the portfolio demonstrate
your learning. Consider the audience for this essay, who will include Frinq faculty as well as
possibly other Frinq students.
<p>
In this final essay support your ideas with examples from your portfolio. For example, when
discussing communication, you might describe how working on revising a particular assignment
helped you better understand how to write for different audiences, or in pondering critical
thinking, you might describe how another assignment challenged your preconceived ideas about a
topic. Please clearly refer to these assignments in the essay and include them in your
portfolio.
<p>
As you write and shape your essay, think about how best to organize it.  Does it make more sense
to order the information chronologically?  From most to least important point? From struggles to
breakthroughs?  In other words, don't just free associate.  Organize your essay into a logical
order that best fits the points you are trying to make.
<p>
This essay is about what <B>you learned</B> not about what <B>you liked</B>.
