<H3>Overview</H3>

<p>
Being able to conduct research and write an effective research paper
is an academic skill you will need to employ frequently in your
college career.  Furthermore the same skills you will need to write an
effective research paper are the same skills you will need in a
successful professional career. Therefore, this term we will spend
considerable time developing the skills necessary for you to become an
effective researcher and research writer.
<p>

Thematically this term we are examining the various ways that we, as
humans, have attempted to understand ourselves through scientific
investigation.  Your research project will allow you to focus on
biotechnology and other relevant current scientific developments and
how these developments could change how we define "human."  The
University Studies Goals which you will continue to develop through
this project are critical thinking and communication and specifically
ethical and social responsibility.
<p>

Be careful that your research paper is an essay in which you develop
your own original thought, i.e., thesis, and not merely a report of
the existing published information on the topic. It will not be merely
a parody of others ideas but rather you will use your research to
develop your own position and ideas on the topic you are examining.
<p>

<p>


<H3>Possible Topics:</H3>
<p>
<BIG><B>Genetic Engineering</B></BIG> a laboratory technique used by scientists to
change the DNA of living organisms. This area of study involves
several areas.  It could be as simple as examining embryos for genetic
diagnosis and screening by potential parents before implantation to
avoid certain biological disorders.  However, it could also involve
actual genetic manipulation of the DNA to create or clone "designer
babies" through either somatic gene therapy or germ-line engineering.
Other technologies associated with this are gene therapy and
Recombinant DNA technology. Other branches of genetic engineering have
involved introducing human DNA to animals, e.g. pigs, for more
harvesting organs for more successful transplanting. Using genetic
engineering in the area of crops and foodstuffs for human consumption,
sometimes referred to as "Frankenfoods" is another example a topic in
this realm one could explore.

<p>
<BIG><B>Artificial Intelligence</B></BIG> also know as machine intelligence, is defined
as intelligence exhibited by anything manufactured (i.e. artificial)
by humans or other sentient beings or systems.  It is sometimes
hypothetically applied to general-purpose computers but is also
applied to robotics and nanotechnology in human medicine.

<p>
<BIG><B>Human Cyborgs</B></BIG> are combinations of people and animals or machines.
Donna Haraway's influential work, A Manifesto for Cyborgs: Science,
Technology, and Social Feminism in the 1980s, defined Cyborgs as "a
cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of
social reality as well as a creature of fiction." We see a meshing of
technology and man in healthcare when humans and technology function
as one, such as with man surviving with a pacemaker, or a woman
surviving with a respirator. In these cases, technology assists
individuals to overcome health problems.

<H2>Part 1 - Research Proposal </H2>


Once you have chosen one of the broad areas of research above, you
will need to think more specifically and methodically about what you
exactly want to research within this larger topic.  For example, while
you may have chosen Artificial Intelligence as your broad topic, you
would need to narrow within that topic to perhaps looking at military
applications of AI.  You will need to gather initial sources and
examine them as to the research available for your topic.  This will
help you determine whether you need to change the focus of your topic
or will help you write a narrowed tentative thesis.  After you have
completed this preliminary research, you will then submit a one page
typed paper proposal which poses your specific research question and
what kinds of information you plan to use in your paper.  In other
words, what do you want to know and what general
information/categories you will need to explore to answer your
question?  An example of a paper proposal follows.

			   Research Proposal
			   </CENTER>
<p>

Research Questions: How will the development of humanlike robots
impact human society and who we define as human?
<p>
Suggested areas of study for the paper:
<p>

In order to answer this question, I will need to find out exactly what
is being done in the area of robotics.  I know already that several of
these areas of research are attempting to make robots more
"humanlike."  That is, they are working on robots who respond to and
convey facial expressions.  There is  research into creating robots
that are self-learning as well as those that look and move like
humans.  I plan to initially discuss exactly what research is being
done in artificial intelligence as it relates to robotics.

<p>

Secondly, I plan to discuss the potential benefits and "dangers"
attached to this research.  Two large questions surface here.  First,
how will these robots potentially aid or enhance human life?  Second,
how will these robots fit into human society?  If they become
sentient, i.e. self thinking, will we accord them the same rights as
biological humans?  If they do become autonomous and independent will
this reality pose a significant threat to existing humans?  The core
of many science fiction movies, starting with Frankenstein, (and more
recently, "I, Robot") have emphasized the fear of technology run amok
but is this more hype then reality?

<p>

Thirdly, I want to examine how this developing technology could
ultimately change the definition of human.  Maybe, humans will no
longer been seen as primarily biological beings.  Maybe we will
develop another criteria by which to determine humanity.  Could this
distinction between biological and mechanical humans create schisms
within society?  How will biological humans be redefined with the
introduction of mechanical humans?  These are questions I am
contemplating.

<p>

Finally, I plan to end my paper with offering specific suggestions to
try to advert potential dangers associated with this developing area.
This may include federal or global restrictions or guidelines.  Maybe
there will need to be some kind of governmental oversight, some
research protocols.

<H2>Part 2 - Annotated  Bibliography</H2>

<p>
An annotated bibliography contains descriptive and evaluative comments
on the sources.  When evaluating, remember that researchers need to be
concerned about the sources they use as evidence.  Some material you
find might be based on incorrect or outdated information, or on poor
logic.  You should use books, scholarly journals, academic articles,
etc.  Newspapers, Popular Magazines (i.e. Time, Newsweek) and
Encyclopedias are not appropriate sources and should be used only as
background material.  Be very careful when evaluating an Internet
source. Please <B>include 5 sources only one of which may be a web site</B>.
<p>
Questions you should consider when choosing a source include: Is the
author you are reading an established voice in the field?  For example
are you citing an established psychology journal to prove your point
about human cloning, or are you citing a source that has recently been
on the bestseller list?  Is the publisher reputable?  How current is
the material?  Can you hold the author accountable for the information
dispersed?  For additional help on the kinds of questions you should
be asking when you are examining your sources go to
<A HREF="http://www.utoronto.ca/writing/litrev.html">http://www.utoronto.ca/writing/litrev.html</A>.
<p>
Please follow correct <A HREF="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/557/01/">MLA</A> formatting.
When listing sources, follow
the same form as you would in completing the Works Cited page of your
final paper.  Your description and evaluative comments about a source
will appear immediately following the citation, as in the example
below.  This description and evaluation should include a brief summary
of the source as well as how you plan to use the source in your
research paper.  What information are you going to pull from it?
<p>
Some additional advice about formatting and annotating bibliographies can be found at the following
web sites.
The <A HREF="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/research/index.html">OWL</A> project
(and especially its <A HREF="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/">page</A> about annotated bibliographies),
and the <A HREF="http://www.liunet.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workshop/citmla.htm">liunet</A> website.

As a guide to formatting bibliographic references, I have included
the following examples (from the OWL project page).

<H4>Example Annotated Bibliography Entry</H4>
<p>
Each item in an annotated bibliography (for this class) has the following
pieces.  Your annotated bibliography <B>will have at least 5 entries</B> formatted in this manner.
<OL>
<LI> A bibliography record formatted in MLA style.
<LI> A brief (2-3 sentence) description or synopsis of what the work is about.
<LI> A comment about how you will use this work in your paper.
<LI> At least 1 (possibly many) quotations, that you might use in the
paper you will be writing.

Here is an example entry I wrote about the Richard Smith's review of
Jared Diamond's book <I>Collapse</I>.
<p>

<SMALL>Richard Smith. "Capitalism and Collapse:
  contradictions of Jared Diamond’s market meliorist strategy to save the humans."
Capitalism Nature Socialism Journal. 16.4(December 2005):
19 - 36. Electronic Journal sources at <A HREF="http://www.cnsjournal.org/">http://www.cnsjournal.org/</A>
<p>
A review of Jared Diamonds book <I>Collapse</I>. Basically agrees
with most of Diamond's analysis of why societies succeed or fail,
but disagrees strongly with Diamond's analysis of the lessons
we should learn from this study. Argues that most societies
can not choose certain paths because they were controlled
by small autocratic groups beyond the control of most
of societies members. That this state has much in common
with our own world, where big money and corporations are
in control, and if we are to avoid the fate of many of
these past societies, we will need to exert more control
over these entities.
<p>
I will use this source to argue that Diamond is the ultimate authority
on the issue of societal failures.

<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Diamond’s thesis is that societies such as the Easter Islanders,
the Greenland Norse, the Anasazi of the American southwest, the
Lowland Mayans and others collapsed largely because they exhausted
the natural resources on which they depended and failed to realize
the need to change, or, inexplicably, refused to change and instead
pursued <I>grim trajectories</I> toward social and economic
disintegration and collapse."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Diamond has opened a fruitful approach to understanding the
dynamics of eco-social collapse. Indeed, I think it’s the most
important history lesson in his book. But the problem is that when
he turns to our modern predicament, he completely <I>forgets</I> his own
lesson."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"But we don't live in a <I>bottom-up</I> democratic society. We live in a
capitalist society in which ownership and control of the economy is
largely in the hands of private corporations who pursue their own
ends and don't answer to society"

<p>
Even after you hand in your research proposal and annotated
bibliography, you may find that you may need to refine your research
question as well as find more sources.  However, if you put in
adequate time and effort into your research proposal, this may not be
significant. Your research proposal is just that, a proposal, and your
thesis and research will inevitably become more focused and specific.

Finally, you should be ready to draft your paper.  Your rough draft
should be as complete as it can be with a developed introduction, body
and conclusion including accurate/complete citing and a Works Cited
page so that your peer review will garner as much helpful information
as possible enabling you to write a polished and convincing draft.

The purpose of this part of the research paper assignment is to find and
use feedback on your writing. <BIG><B>You will hand in a draft that has been
marked up and commented on by a peer reviewer.</B></BIG>


<H3>How to structure your paper.</H3>

The developments which have occurred in biotechnology and related
scientific areas have caused many to speculate that these developments
will so alter humans and human society that we will move into a
"posthuman" stage of history.  Listed below are some specific areas of
scientific development associated with these changes. After choosing a
topic which interests you, you will need to do some initial reading in
order to arrive at a narrowed topic and eventually a thesis.  You will
not be able to create a workable thesis and research proposal without
first educating yourself somewhat on the topic you are examining.
Once you have arrived at a workable focus/thesis for your paper, you
will need to address the following components in your paper.  Listed
below is the recommended order of the sections although #2 and #3
could be reversed.

<ol>

<LI> Explanation of the scientific development. (This will be based
primarily on information in your sources.)

<LI> The potential benefits and dangers of this new scientific
development both for individual humans and society as a whole. (Again,
this will be from research but could include your own observations as
well.) In this section you will include data presented in graphical
form related to the scientific development or the audience (potential
beneficiaries and/or those potentially harmed)

<LI> You <B><BIG>MUST address the ethical and social responsibilities</BIG></B> involved
in this science and the use of this science. To whom might it be
dangerous? Why? What kinds of safeguards may be needed to protect
society and even the scientists themselves?

<LI> How the scientific development impacts or will potentially impact
our understanding of what it means to be human. (This will come from
both your analysis and research.)

<LI> Specific recommendations about how to use/apply this technology
in the future in order to benefit humankind and avoid potential
dangers. (Again, this combines both your own analysis and research.)

</ol>

<p>
Construct and turn in a first draft of a 6-8 page research paper
which elaborates your research proposal.
A successful paper will have a strong thesis statement supported by a detailed analysis of
the works of others that support your ideas. It will use plenty of evidence, and
the sources of such evidence will be clearly identified.

<p>

I will use a grading rubric similar to the following
<ul>
<Li> You hand in a complete draft. 6-8 pages, which includes
<ol>
<LI> Your paper follows the 5-part structure outlined above
<LI> Appropriate length (6-8 pages)
<LI> A good thesis paragraph. not too broad, a little controversial, clear and unambiguous
<LI> Sections and paragraphs that clearly support the thesis.
<LI> Sections and paragraphs that anticipate arguments against the thesis.
<LI> Good use of evidence.
<LI> You discuss the ethical issues.
<LI> Fits the theme of your research proposal.
<LI> A bibliography in MLA style (<B>NOT your annotated bibliography</B>)
<LI> Correct spelling, punctuation, grammar.
<LI> Original and interesting to read
</ol>

<LI> You're draft includes markups and comments by your peer reviewer.
 <B>Hand in the original marked up draft</B>. Keep a zerox copy of the marked up draft for you own use.
<LI> It is your job to find an appropriate peer reviewer. You will be judged
on the quality, quantity, and appropriateness of the peer reviewers comments.
I suggest you put some thought into who you want to use as a peer reviewer.

</ul>
<p>

<B>Note: you must hand in a copy of your paper which has peer-reviewed comments on
it to receive a final grade on this assignment!</B>
<p>

I will<B> not </B>be handing back your
peer reviewed first draft. You have until March 4th to make substantial revisions of your
first draft. <STRONG>DO
NOT</STRONG> just fix a few typos. I expect students to address the comments
of their peers reviewers in a substantial
manner. You may want to get additional advice on your draft as you work on
your final version.

<p>
I will use a grading rubric similar to the following. Note the heavy weighting to
given to substantial revision of the work. I will actually compare your
draft to your final version. I will be looking for substantial improvements.

<ul>
<LI> <STRONG>30 point. Addresses peer comments. Makes substantial revisions.</STRONG>

<H2>Help</H2>
<p>

<STRONG>Writing Center: </STRONG> I strongly recommend making at least one appointment with the writing center
NOW. It is best to meet with them when you have a clearly defined topic and at least some
preliminary writing. If you wait until the end of the term you will not get an appointment.
It would be appropriate to have three or more appointments if writing is a challenge for you.
Even someone who already writes well can benefit from an expert opinion.

<p>

<STRONG>Library: </STRONG> Don't be shy about asking for help in the library. Our library contact for Cyber
Millenium is Michael Bowman. He will be the most familiar with what we are doing. But any of
the librarians are happy to help with questions, so if Michael is not available just ask at the
desk. Also see the <A HREF="http://www.lib.pdx.edu/instruction/survivalguide/index.htm">Research Survival Guide</A>.
