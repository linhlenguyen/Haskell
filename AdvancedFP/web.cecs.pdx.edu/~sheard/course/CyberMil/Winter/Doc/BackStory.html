"I’ll have another one" he said while still finishing off the
first. Suddenly it didn’t seem all that long ago. Do you want
to play a general game or do you want to play another grand
master? The familiar extinctathon gateway addressed him as he
signed on. There was no question however what was going to
happen next. Crake was a new grandmaster and there was nothing
that was going to keep him from playing the best. That of
course was not going to happen; his stomach sunk just thinking
about what happened next.

Maybe he had one too many drinks, or maybe the weight of his
decisions finally coming down on him all at once. "What is
this?" Crake said as the screen brought up the familiar lily
pad labyrinth through servers erasing each time erasing his
footprints but this wasn’t his and he didn’t run it. "Was it
the game?" He had heard about traps like this. CorpSeCorps does
this often, people getting caught trying to help some crazy
Animal Liberation org.

 <p>"Where’s my drink?" Crake shouted he was in a hurry it
 should be starting soon. He looked down at the cell phone "8
 missed calls" said Crake  After setting down his drink he
 dials Jimmy "Where are you?" Jimmy yelled "Don’t you know
 what’s going on?" "Not to worry." Said Crake "Everything’s
 under control." He had done what he needed to do; now to tie
 up loose ends.
