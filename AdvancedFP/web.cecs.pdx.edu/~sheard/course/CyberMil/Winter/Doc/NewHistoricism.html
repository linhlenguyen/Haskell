New Historicism evaluates how the work is influenced by the time in
which it was produced. It also examines the social sphere in which the
author moved, the psychological background of the author, the books
and theories that may have influenced the author, and any other
factors which influenced the work of art. All work is biased.

<p>
In this assignment you are to
<ul>
<li> Pick a single reference from the book Oryx and Crake.
<li> Identify several places in the book where it is used.
<li> Then try and identify actual historical events or things that might have
led the author to use this reference.
<li> Many times the actual reference is distorted or exagerated to create
the literary referenence. Was this done? if so how?
<li> Sometimes several events or things are combined. Was this the case?
<li> Write one page report. Identify the literary reference. Identify
as many actual references as you can that may have led to the literary reference.
<li> Explain how the actual references were "morphed" in to the literary one.
<li> Speculate about why the author chose that reference.
