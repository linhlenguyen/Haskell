<LI> Do the ideas in the notes flow together to make a unifiable whole? Could
you tell from reading the notes, what the paper the notes summarize was about?
In 3 or 4 sentences, reiterate in your own words, what you think the
paper is about from reading the notes you are reviewing. (I ask the note taking
coach to do this summary, so that the author can judge if he has expressed his
intent clearly. If your idea of the paper and the author's (own) idea of the
paper differ widely, this tells the note's author something.)
