The next assignment is to meet with me one-on-one for ten minutes. You
get full credit for showing up at the meeting.

<p>
Please sign up for one of the times below. Please note that all
meetings are in my office in the Computer Science Building, in the
Fourth Ave Building, FAB 120-04. See here for a <A HREF="../DirecToMyOffice.html">map</A> and directions.

<p>
The reasons I am meeting with everyone are:

<OL>

<LI>I want to get to know each student a little better. How are things
going for you? What courses are you taking? Are you getting all
your work handed in on time?

<LI> I want everyone to know where my office is.

<LI>I want to get feedback from each student about how they feel about
the class. Are their things you are uncertain about? Do you know
what I expect from you? Are you understanding the material?

<LI>I want to find out from each student what they need,
that they are not currently getting.

<LI>I want to solicit suggesstions for ways to improve the class.

<LI>I want to find time where each student can ask me individual questions.
Perhaps there hasn't been the time or the opportunity to ask a
question that you really want answered.

</OL>
