<H2>In Class Free Write</H2>

On a clean piece of paper, write a 1 page essay based upon chapters 3-7 of "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep".
<p>
The goal of the free write is to be creative. The essay should fill in
details that are not in the book. Again, nothing is too bizarre, as long as you can
point to evidence in the first seven chapters that support your claim.
<p>
Some Example topics:
<ul>
<LI> A back-story history of what Rick Dekard did during World War Terminus.
<LI> A stream of consciousness of Rachael Rosen when she first understands that she is an Android.
<LI> A History of Mercerism.
<LI> A police report from Dave Holden detailing the incident where he was shopt by the Android.
<LI> A transcript of the phone discussion between Inspector Harry Bryant and Eldon Rosen
setting up the tests to be performed by Rick Dekard at Rosen Industries.
<LI> A job interview for J.R Isadore at the Van Ness Animal Hospital with Hannibal Sloat.
<LI> An analysis of why animals are such an important part of 2028 SFO culture.
</ul>
<p>
You may use one of these ideas, or make up one of your own.

<H2>Mentor Session Peer Comments and Looping</H2>
<p>
In mentor session. Pick a partner. Read each others essay. Discuss each others essay.
Try and make helpful comments about how to improve the essay.
<ol>
<LI> What was the best part? Why was it the best part?
<Li> What didn't you understand? Are there ideas that are missing?
<LI> Was there text that was particulary difficult to follow? How could it be improved.
<LI> Can you relate each part of the essay to some hint in the book? If not, can you
alter the text to make the relationship stronger.

</ol>

Now enter the text into an electronic document (a text document using Notepad,
or a Microsoft Word document). Use the looping strategy to revise and improve
the essay.
