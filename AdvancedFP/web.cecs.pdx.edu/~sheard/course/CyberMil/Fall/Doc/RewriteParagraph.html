In some states voter registration cards are being mailed to
voters, and legitimate voters can't cast there votes. This is
because if a card comes back, that voter is removed from the list
of good voters. This didn't used to happen because voting lists
were county wide, but the "America Votes Act" made centralized
lists mandatory. These list are new and many errors happened when
they were created. A card might come back if the zip code was bad
for example. Computerized lists of convicted felons in Alabama
were used to remove some people. The felon lists had some non-
felons listed and the wrong people were removed such as pardoned
and newly released prisoners and people with the same name. In at
least one case the removal of many people was caused by a real
felon the same name.  Voter rolls often contain inaccurate
information. These inaccuracies may lead to keeping real voters
from voting.
