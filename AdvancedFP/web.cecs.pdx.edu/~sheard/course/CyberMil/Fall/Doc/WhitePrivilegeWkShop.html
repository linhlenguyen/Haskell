The concept of white privilege is complex and can be difficult to
explore. The facilitators for this session will endeavor to create safe
space and allow ample time for discussion to unfold. We will begin by
participants sharing their thoughts and questions about the white
privilege concept, and follow this with a facilitator-led discussion.
After that, we will conduct a brief exercise based on an article by
Peggy McIntosh. Many people find that exploring the topic of white
privilege deepens their understanding and awareness of racism and opens
their ability to discuss the social dynamics of race with others.
Please come join in the conversation.
