<U><B>Part 2 Observe</B>: Perform user observations and use those to define design criteria.</U>
Turn in documentation of observations (photographs and/or descriptions),
conclusions based on those observations, and a list of at least 8 criteria.
<UL>

  <LI><B>Observation</B>:  observe at least 3 people.  You can also observe yourself if
  you can be objective.
    <UL>
      <LI>Observe the behaviors of users and how they interact
      with the object and their environment.

      <LI>Note that the <U>task</U> is what is important, not the object.
      Perhaps the user is currently using a different object to do
      the same task.
    </UL>

  <LI><B>Documentation of observation</B>
    <UL>
       <LI>Photographs.  If the user does not want to be photographed you
       can still clearly document the environment and existing
       object(s) with photos.

       <LI>Written descriptions of behavior, about one short paragraph
       for each observation.  Things to consider:
          <UL>
             <LI>What is the task?  Consider the GOAL.  Similar to the problem
             statement.

             <LI>What are the methods?  A flowchart can be helpful.

             <LI>Where are the tasks performed?  Is this always the same?

             <LI>What other tools are used?

             <LI>How often is this done?

             <LI>Is time important?

             <LI>How were the users influenced by the environment or the
             object?

             <LI>What are the similarities or differences between users?
          </UL>
    </UL>

   <LI><B>Conclusions</B> based on observations.  What is the task?
   What are the methods?  What user needs can you identify
   from this exercise?  One paragraph.

   <LI><B>Criteria</B> for evaluating design.
     <UL>
       <LI>Must include Universal Design criteria (See below).  Those
       should be restated in a way that applies to the problem
       at hand.

       <LI>What does flexibility in use mean in this case?
       For my fresh air solution it could mean working in
       different windows.  It should also provide for use by
       users of different capabilities.

       <LI>Must include cost and could include some aesthetic
       measurement.

       <LI>Must comprehend user needs identified above (at least 2 in addition to Universal Design criteria)

       <LI>Overall you should have at least 8 criteria.
    </UL>

   <LI><B>Grading</B>:  Five points for clear documentation of observations (photos,
   sketches, or detailed descriptions) and the conclusions you have drawn from
   them.  Five points for generating eight criteria clearly linked to observations
   and Universal Design.  You must include most Universal Design principles (See below) and
   restate in a more specific manner.
 </UL>

As discussed in-class the seven princilples of Universal Design are:

<ol>

<LI> <B>Equitable Use</B>. The design is useful and marketable to
people with diverse abilities.

<LI> <B>Flexibility in Use</B>. The design accommodates a wide
range of individual preferences and abilities.

<LI><B>Simple and Intuitive Use</B>. Use of the design is easy to
understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge,
language skills, or current concentration level.

<LI><B>Perceptible Information</B>. The design communicates
necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of
ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.

<LI><B>Tolerance for Error</B>. The design minimizes hazards and
the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.

<LI><B>Low Physical Effort</B>. The design can be used efficiently
and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.

<LI><B>Size and Space for Approach and Use</B>. Appropriate size
and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use
regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.
</ol>
