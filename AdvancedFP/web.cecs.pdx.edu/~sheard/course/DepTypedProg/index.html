This course is
a graduate CS 520 (CRN 64271) and senior CS 410 (CRN 64270) seminar
about dependently types programing.
In this course we will use the Omega language which supports a simple
form of dependently typed programming which is very similar to Haskell.
<p>
Here are some of the <B>topics</B> we might cover.
<p>
<ol>
<li> The Curry-Howard isomorphism.
<li> Tagless typed interpreters.
<li> Data-generic programming (i.e. Maps at all types, generic show, generic marshalling).
<li> Size generic programming (i.e. List based maps for 1,2,3, ... lists).
<li> Typed meta-programming (i.e. programs that write programs).
<li> Logical relations as witness types.
<li> Programming at the type level.
<li> Types and hardware descriptions.
<li> Programming language meta-theory (Subject reduction).
</ol>
