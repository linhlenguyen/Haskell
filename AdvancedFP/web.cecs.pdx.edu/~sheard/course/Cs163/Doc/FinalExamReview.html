<BIG>Final Exam Review</BIG>
</CENTER>

<p>
The final exam will focus (75%) on material studied
since the mid-term. A small part of the exam (25%) will
focus on material studied in the first half of the class (Haskell, sorting, searching, hash-tables).
<p>
Key points to review for the final exam fall in the
following categories.
<ul>
<li> Game Trees
  <ol> <li> Variable branching factor
       <li> Depth v.s. Breadth first search
