<p>
To write a program one follows a recipe of steps. Here are the steps
we will use for all our programs.
<ul>
<li> Each step is a concrete activity
<li> Each step has a product that can be inspected
</ul>
<p>
Here are the steps we will follow:
<p>

<ul>
<li> Understand the problem. The <A HREF="SortingAnalysis.html">sorting analysis</A> is an example of the product one produces in the understanding phase.
Often the analysis is inserted in the program as a comment.
<li> Write a contract for each function about how its inputs and outputs behave.
In Haskell, a contract is written using a typing prototype.

<li> Create a set of examples. We will use HUnit assertions as the product
that encodes examples.
<li> Write the body of each function. Use the guideline that the structure
of the body follows the structure of the input data.
<li> Testing. Test your program. We will use HUnit tests
as the testing product. Later we will learn how to use QiuckCheck random testing as additonal testing
products.
</ul>

If you do not have all the products then you have not followed the design
recipe, and you are much more likely to make mistakes.
