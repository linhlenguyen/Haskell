<p>
In this worksheet you will analyze Hashing and Radix Sort.
<p>

</ol>
<li>
Given a hashtable with N buckets and K keys what is the expected
average time to access an element. Do the computation two ways
<ol> <li> When N is much greater than K
     <li> When K is much greater than N
     </ol>

<li> Given a hashtable with N buckets and K keys what is cost in terms of
space: The space required to construct the data structure when it is full with
K elements.



<li> What happens when a hash function maps multiple keys to the same
location in the hash table. Name two ways to resolve this. Give
specific data structures you might use.




<li> Please show each pass of the radix sort for the following array of
numbers: 234 876 875 458 098 348 589 345.

<li> What is its running cost in time as a proportion to the
input size.

<li> What special properties must hold to use a radix sort

</ol>
