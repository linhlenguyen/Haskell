All programs mentioned can be downloaded from the this document
<ul><li> <A HREF="../code/hw5/Hw5.hs">Hw5.hs</A>. A definitional interpreter (in Haskell) for language E5.
<li>  <A HREF="../code/hw5/static.e5">static.e5</A>. A sample E5 program.

</ul>

<p>

This homework has two parts. First, altering the definitional interpreter for a small
functional language, and Second, writing a few small programs in a functional language (Haskell).

<ol>

<li> Consider the following functional language, which we'll call E5.


<PRE>
prog := { decl } 'in' exp

exp := var
| int
| char
| '(' '=' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'if' exp exp exp ')'
| '(' 'let' { decl } 'in' exp ')'
| '(' 'lambda' ( {var} ) exp ')'
| '(' '@' exp exp { exp } ')'
| '(' '+' exp exp ')'
| '(' '-' exp exp ')'
| '(' '*' exp exp ')'
| '(' '/' exp exp ')'
| '(' '<=' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'pair' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'fst' exp ')'
| '(' 'snd' exp ')'
| '(' 'ispair' exp ')'
| '(' 'ischar' exp ')'
| '(' 'isint' exp ')'

var := letter { letter | digit }

decl := '(' 'fun' var '(' { var } ')' exp ')'
| '(' 'val' var exp ')'
</PRE>

<p>
As usual, comments may be included by enclosing them between comment braces '{-' and '-}'
characters, and they may be nested.

<p>

E5 is similar to some of our earlier languages (especially E4),
it retains characters and their operations,
but lacks imperative features including assignment, while , block , and write.
<p>
The local
expression has been renamed let (to emphasize that it acts like an
Haskell-style immutable binding). A let contains a series of zero or more declarations,
the keyword 'in', and then an expression which acts as the body of the let. The value of a let
is the value of its body, BUT, the body is evaluated in an enriched environment, which contains
local bindings for the values and functions introduced by the let's declarations.
<p>
There are two kinds of declarations: 'fun' and 'val'. A 'val' declaration is much like a 'local'
declaration from language E4. A declaration (val x exp), extends the environment with the name
'x', binding it to the value of 'exp'.

<p>

The most important changes are in the treatment of functions, which can be defined
in two ways.
<ol>
<li> The most common is the use of the function declaration '(' 'fun' var { var } exp ')' in a 'let' expression.
for example, to evaluate (let (fun f (x y) (+ x (- y 1))) in (@ f 2 6)), first create a binary function 'f'
value whose formal arguments are 'x' and 'y' , whose body is  (+ x (- y 1)), and whose environment
is the current environment; then bind f to that function value and
evaluate (@ f 2 6)) in the resulting local environment.

<li> The other way is called an anonymous function, or lambda expression '(' 'lambda' '(' {var } ')' exp ')'.
For example:
(\ (x y) exp) introduces a nameless function with two formal parameters 'x' and 'y' and a body 'exp'.
</ol>
<p>

Functions are treated as just another kind of value, and they share the same name
space as other values.

<p>

Applications now take an arbitrary expression in the function position; this must
evaluate to a function value. Functions take an arbitrary number of
additional arguments (including zero). Functions are completely "first-class",  i.e.,
they can be passed as arguments to, or returned as results of, other functions, and
can be stored in pairs. A program is a series of declarations, the keyword 'in' follwoed
by an expression. The value of the program is the value of this expression,
evaluated in an environment created by the declarations.

<p>

The web site gives several example E5 programs. Program <A HREF="../code/hw5/static.e5">static.e5</A>
illustrates that nested functions use static scoping rules; program
<A HREF="../code/hw5/compose.e5">compose.e5</A> shows how to write a higher-order function that composes two
existing functions.

<p>

An E5 interpreter in Haskell (only) has been provided ( <A HREF="../code/hw5/hw5.hs">hw5.hs</A> ).

<p>

In the E5 language there are exactly 4 kinds of values. Ints, Characters, Pairs, and Functions.
There are 3 predicates on values: <B>ispair</B>, <B>ischar</B>, and <B>isint</B>. With these
you can test what kind of value any object takes.

In addition, the interpreter for E5 attempts to recognize the convention we have used to encode lists.
Recall that convention, it uses right-nested pairs ending in 0. For example <B>(pair 4 (pair 'z' 0))</B>
evaluates to <B>(4.('z'.0))</B>. In the interpreter for E5 if such a right-nested
pair is recognized it is printed as <B>[4,'z']</B>. The interpreter also recognizes
right-nested pairs of characters, and prints them as strings. For example
<B>(pair 'a' (pair 'b' (pair 'c' 0)))</B> prints as <B>"abc"</B>.  There are still only
4 kinds of values, though we print some of them using the list conventions.
Here are some examples
<ol>
<li> <B>(pair 4 (pair 5 (pair 9 0)))</B> prints as    <B>[4,5,9]</B> .
<li> <B>(pair 3 (pair 5 6))</B> print as  <B>(3.(5.6))</B>. Note that while it is right nested,
it does not end in <B>0</B>, so the list form is <EM>not</EM> used.
<li> <B>(pair 'd' (pair 'z' (pair '3' 0)))</B> print as  <B>"dz3"</B>.
<li> <B>(pair 'a' (pair 'b' (pair 5 0)))</B> prints as
<B>['a','b',5]</B>. Note that is starts out looking like a list of Character, but the last
element is not a Character, so we can't print it as a string. But it stills looks like a list.

</ol>

<p>
<H3>What to do.</H3>
<p>
You will need to write some small E5 programs. You will also modify
the definitional interpreter. You might try adding the <A HREF="../code/hw3/lists.e3">list convention
functions</A> to an E5 program. While the idea is the same, the format
of definitions is very different in E5 than in E3 and E4. This would be good practice before
you start.
<UL>

<Li> Modify compose.e5 so that the compose function is Curried, rather
than taking its arguments as a single pair. Put your solution in file <B>sol5A.e5</B>
(20 points).

<li> Modify the interpreter to allow E5 functions to be recursive . For
example, program <A HREF="../code/hw5/map.e5">map.e5</A> (which currently fails with an unbound variable
error) should work properly when you're done. This requires only a very
small change. But be careful: programs like <B>static.e5</B> must also continue
to work when you're done!  To do this you will need to make one small change
in the <B>elab</B> function (near line 332, the case for FunDecl).
The <B>elab</B> function is used in the read-eval-print loop, and in the Let case
of the interpreter (line 298). Without the use of <B>elab</B>
function the read-eval-print loop (line 741) wouldn't know what definition are in scope
(40 points).

<p>
Turn in a file named <B>hw5A.hs</B> in to D2L which is your
modified interpreter.



</ul>

<p>


Note that this interpreter has some significant changes from the previous one for E4. We
no longer use a stack, just an environment and a heap. There is
a (single) environment (because both functions and other values can now be stored
in the same name space). The environment now maps all identifiers directly to addresses
in the heap. But, we use addresses only when we allocate
new cells in the heap, We never change values in the heap since there is no assignment
(or call by reference).

<p>




<li>

Implement the following functions in Haskell using the Haskell function foldr,
without using explicit recursion. Submit your solutions to both the exercises in a single file
<B>sol5B.hs</B>.

<ul>


<li> <B>rev:: [a] -> [a]</B>
reverses an arbitrary list. You make take the "built-in" library function
(<B>++</B>) (append) as primitive. The function you write should reverse a list. For example
<B>rev [1,2,5]</B> --->  <B>[5,2,1]</B> (20 points)

<li> <B>forall : (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool</B> , where <B>(forall f l)</B> returns <B>True</B>,
if for every element <B>x</B> in <B>l</B> , <B>(f x)</B> evaluates to <B>True</B> , or <B>l</B> is empty
(20 points).

<li> <B>Extra Credit</B>. Do this for fun only. It is <B>not required</B>, and it is worth
<B>zero points</B>, but it is interesting. Redo the definitions for <B>rev</B> and <B>forall</B>
using explicit tail recursion and the accumulator style, as discussed in the <A HREF="../notes/funLangNotes.hs">companion notes</A>. Can
you write them in continuation passing style as well? Call these functions
revAcc forallAcc and revCPS and forallCPS in your solution.
</ul>


</ol>
