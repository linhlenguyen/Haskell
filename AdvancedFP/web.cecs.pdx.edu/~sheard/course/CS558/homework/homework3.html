<p>

All the questions concern a simple language with imperative expressions, functions, global
variables, and pairs, which we'll call E3. Its "concretized" abstract syntax is given by the
following grammar:

<PRE>
prog := '(' { def } ')' exp
def := globaldef | fundef
globaldef := '(' 'global' var exp ')'
fundef := '(' 'fun' fname '(' { var } ')' exp ')'
exp := var
| int
| '(' ':=' var exp ')'
| '(' 'while' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'if' exp exp exp ')'
| '(' 'write' exp ')'
| '(' 'block' { exp } ')'
| '(' '@' fname { exp } ')'
| '(' '+' exp exp ')'
| '(' '-' exp exp ')'
| '(' '*' exp exp ')'
| '(' '/' exp exp ')'
| '(' '<=' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'pair' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'fst' exp ')'
| '(' 'snd' exp ')'
| '('  'ispair' exp ')'
fname := letter { letter | digit }
var := letter { letter | digit }
</PRE>

<p>

As before, comments may be included by enclosing them between comment braces '{-' and
'-}' characters, and they may be nested.

<p>

The informal semantics of E3 programs is as follows. Values include
integers and pairs, each of which has a left and a right component
value. A program <B>(d1 ... dn) e </B>is evaluated by elaborating each
definition <B>d1</B> , . . . <B>dn</B> in that order and then evaluating
the top-level expression <B>e</B> , whose value is the program result. A global
definition <B>(global x e )</B> is elaborated by evaluating its initializing
expression <B>e</B> to a value <B>v</B> and extending the variable
environment with a binding from <B>x</B> to <B>v</B> . A function definition is
elaborated by recording the function name in an environment of available
functions.


<p>

Functions and variables live in separate name spaces, so their names may overlap. The
language uses a combination of static and dynamic scope rules. Function names are handled
dynamically; the most recently elaborated definition with a matching name is used. Global
variable names and the formal parameters of functions
are statically scoped. A global variable's scope reaches from its
definition to the end of the file in which it appears.
The scope of a formal parameter is statically limited to the body of the function.
If a second global variable has the same name as a previous global,
the second hides the first. In a similar manner, if a formal
parameter has the same name as a global, the parameter hides the global. It is a checked
runtime error to use an undefined function or variable name.

<p>

The semantics of E3 expressions are similar to those of E2, with the
following extensions:

<ul>

<li> A variable <B>x</B> can refer to either a formal
parameter or a global. <p>


<li> Evaluating the function application expression <B>(@ f e1 ... en)</B>
evaluates <B>e1</B> ,. . . , <B>en</B> in that order, binds the resulting values to
the n formal parameters of function <B>f</B> , evaluates the body of <B>f</B> in the
resulting environment, and yields the resulting value. It is a checked
runtime error if <B>f</B> does not exist or has the wrong number of parameters.
<p>

<li> Evaluating <B>(pair e1 e2)</B> evaluates <B>e1</B> and <B>e2</B> (in that order) to
values <B>v1</B> and <B>v2</B> , and yields a new pair whose left element is <B>v1</B> and
whose right element is <B>v2</B>.
<p>

<li> Evaluating <B>(fst e)</B> evaluates <B>e</B> to a pair value, and extracts and
yields the left element value. It is a checked runtime error is e
evaluates to a non-pair value.
<p>


<li> Evaluating <B>(snd e)</B> evaluates <B>e</B> to a pair value, and extracts and
yields the right element value. It is a checked runtime error is e
evaluates to a non-pair value.
<p>

<li> Evaluating <B>(ispair e)</B> evaluates <B>e</B> and yields <B>1</B> if the result is a
pair, <B>0</B> otherwise.
<p>


<li> The value tested by <B>if</B> or <B>while</B> must be an integer;
otherwise, a checked runtime error results.
<p>

<li> The value written by <B>write</B> can be either an integer or a pair.
<p>

<li> The arithmetic operators ( <B>+</B> , <B>-</B> , <B>*</B> , <B>/</B> , <B><=</B> ) work only on
integers; it is a checked runtime error to apply them on a pair.

</ul>


An E3 interpreter in Haskell (only) has been provided ( hw3.hs ).

<p>

As usual, it reads a file containing an E3 program in the syntax
described above, echoes the program (to confirm correct parsing),
evaluates the program (possibly producing output from write
expressions), and displays the evaluation result, and then enters a READ-EVAL-PRINT loop.
Users may type in expressions and see what they evaluate to. To exit the loop
type ":q", one may also flip the tracing mode by typing "trace".

<p>

<H3>What you should do.</H3>
<p>

<ol>

<li> <B>(A)</B> Pairs and Lists:  <B>sol3A.e3</B>

<p>
Write the following list-manipulation functions in
E3. Put both your function definitions and a test expression that
exercises them in a single file <B>sol3A.e3</B> and submit that file. Some
useful list manipulation examples are in <A HREF="http://?">lists.e3</A> . You may find it
easier (or just more fun!) to write your solutions in recursive
functional style (like the <B>append</B> example) rather than in imperative
style (like <B>gen</B> and <B>length</B>).

<ul>

<li> <B>(@min l)</B> returns the minimum value in list <B>l</B>. You can assume that l is a
non-empty list of integers; i.e., any other argument may cause an unchecked runtime
error. Hint: If you try a recursive functional solution, you'll need to write an
auxiliary function with two parameters.


<li>

<B>(@zip l1 l2)</B> returns a list obtained by pairing up the corresponding
elements of l1 and l2 .

For example,
<p>
<B>(@zip (@list3 1 2 3) (@list3 4 5 6))</B>
<p>
yields
<p>

<B>((1.4).((2.5).((3.6).0)))</B>.

<p>
Also,
<p>
<B>(@length (@zip l1 l2)) = (@min (@list2  (@length l1) (@length l2)))</B>
<p>

Hint: The recursive functional style really works
better here. (25 points)

</ul>

<li> <B>(B)</B> Local variables: <B>sol3B.hs</B>

<p>
Modify the E3 interpreter to support local variables, by adding a new expression form:

<PRE>
exp := ...
     | '(' 'local' '(' { var exp } ')' exp ')'
</PRE>



where the parenthesized list specifies a set of local variable names and
associated initializing expressions.


<p>

The informal semantics of <B>(local ( x1 e1 ... xn en ) e)</B> is as
follows: evaluate <B>e1</B> ,. . . , <B>en</B> in that order, bind the resulting
values to newly created local variables <B>x1</B> , . . . , <B>xn</B> respectively,
then evaluate <B>e</B> in the resulting environment, and yield the resulting
value. (Do not worry about what happens if two of the variables have the
same name.)

<p>

The scope of the local variables is just the expression <B>e</B> . If a local
variable has the same name as a parameter or global, it hides the
parameter or global.

<p>

For example, the program

<p>

<PRE>
(
(global a 10)
)
(local (a 1 b a)
(block
(local (a 100)
(block
(:= b (+ a b))
(:= a 0)))
(+ a b)))
</PRE>


<p> should evaluate to 111 .

<p>

Most of the necessary parsing support is already present in hw3.hs . All you
have to do is
<ul>
<li> Add the AST (add a case to the <B>data</B> for <B>Exp</B>, and replace the "error" call in "local"
with your constructor, near line 391)
<li> Printing(uncomment the case for Local in <B>ppExp</B>, near line 560), and
<li> evaluation code (add a case to <B>interpE</B>) for local (near line 297).
</ul>
<p>
Put
your solution in a file <B>sol3B.hs</B>. Hint: You don't need to introduce an
additional environment component for local variables; just use the existing
vars environment which currently holds parameters. You might want to study
the interpE case for <B>(At f args)</B> (near line 213). The function application case
has some similar components to the local case. Remember that local
expressions can be nested.
(25 points)


<li> <B>(C)</B> Mutable pairs:  <B>sol3C.hs</B> and <B>sol3C.e3</B>


<ol>
<li> Further modify the E3 interpreter you produced for the local variable problem, by adding two new
expression forms to the E3 language:

<p>

<PRE>
exp := ...
     | '(' 'setfst' exp exp ')'
     | '(' 'setsnd' exp exp ')'
</PRE>

<p>

Most of the necessary parsing support is already present in hw3.hs . All you
have to do is
<ul>
<li> Add the AST (add a cases to the <B>data</B> for <B>Exp</B> for setfst and setsnd).
<li> Parsing replace the "error" calls in "setfst"
and setsnd with your constructors (near line 394 and 397).
<li> Printing add cases for "setfst" and "setsnd" in ppExp (near line 540). Model
after the case for Pair (line 557) which also has two arguments.
<li> evaluation code (add a cases to <B>interpE</B>) for setfst and setsnd (near line 297).
</ul>
<p>

The informal semantics of these expressions is as follows. To evaluate
<B>(setfst e1 e2)</B> , first evaluate <B>e1</B> to a value <B>v1</B> , which must be a
pair, then evaluate <B>e2</B> to a value <B>v2</B> , then update the left component
of <B>v1</B> with <B>v2</B> , and yield the (updated) pair <B>v1</B> as result. setsnd is
similar, except that the right component of <B>v1</B> is updated. For either
expression, it is a checked runtime error if <B>v1</B> is not a pair.

<p>
Note that
the value printing code can now go into an infinite loop for some programs
that use <B>setfst</B> and <B>setsnd</B>; don't worry
about this. Put your solution in a file <B>sol3C.hs</B> (25 points).


<li> Test your solution to part (b) by writing an E3 function <B>nreverse</B>
that reverses a list in place , that is, without constructing any new
pairs. Hint: You'll need <B>setsnd</B> but not <B>setfst</B>. Again, your can use
either a functional recursive style or an imperative style. Submit a
test program defining and using <B>nreverse</B> called <B>sol3C.e3</B> (10 points).

<li> <B>(D)</B> Formal Operational Semantics:  <B>sol3D.pdf</B>
<p>

This problem can be written using paper and pencil, scanned and then submitted.
You are are also allowed to use any other tools that will let you
create a *.pdf document for submission.


Consider the operational semantics rules presented in lecture.

<ol>
<li> Write down a rule for the block expression form of E3. For
simplicity, assume that each block has exactly two sub-expressions.
<p>

<li> Write down a rule for a new expression form <B>(alias x1 x2 e )</B> ,
whose informal semantics is as follows: make the newly created local
variable <B>x1</B> an alias to the existing variable <B>x2</B> , evaluate <B>e</B> in the
resulting environment, and yield the resulting value. Note that alias is
not the same as local : when two variables are aliased, they refer to
the same location. (Note: A simple variable aliasing form like this is
not very useful, but many real languages introduce aliasing less
directly --  although this is often considered a bad feature, because it
makes it easy to write confusing programs.)
<p>

<li> Write down the full derivation tree for the following judgment:

<PRE>
<(local x 1 (block (alias y x (+ (:= x 3) (:= y 5))) x)),&Oslash;,&Oslash;> &yen; <5,&Oslash;>
</PRE>


<p>

Use symbolic names (e.g., <I>l1</I> ; <I>l2</I> ; ...  ) for locations. When writing
concrete environments and stores, use set notation, e.g.
Suppose E = { x -> <I>lx</I> ; y -> <I>ly</I> }. We may treat the environment E as a function.
If we apply it to name, we get the location of that name. For example E ( x ) = <I>lx</I>
and E( y ) = <I>ly</I> .
Write &Oslash; for the empty environment or store. (Hint: use a pencil and a
broad sheet of paper. Your completed tree should have ten nodes.).
Submit your answer as file <B>sol3D.pdf</B> (15 points)  to D2L.
