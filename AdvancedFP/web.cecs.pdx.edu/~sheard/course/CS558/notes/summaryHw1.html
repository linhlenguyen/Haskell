<ol>
<li> The meaning of a program is a simple value. Here it is an integer.
<li> There are no variables or any other kind of state.

in this example the stack machine.
<p>
<li> A processor has a number of stages.
<ol>
<li> Parsing from a file to an intermediate data structure.
<li> Building an input to the abstract machine.
<li> Executing the abstract machine on this input
<li> Communicating the result to the real world.
