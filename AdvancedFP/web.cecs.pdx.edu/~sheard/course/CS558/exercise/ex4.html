<li> What are some benefits of having functions be first class values in a programming language?
<li> What are subroutine and object closures?  What are they used for?
<li> What types of language features generally differentiate functional and imperative languages?  Why do you think functional languages have these differences?
<li> Compare the eager and lazy evaluation schemes.  What are some advantages/disadvantages of both?
<li> What does it mean if we say a language has no side effects?  Can you think of some reasons we might prefer such a language over one that does have side effects?
<li> What are IO actions and what purpose do they serve?
<li> Explain the characteristics of scripting languages
<li> Why do you think there is a need for scripting languages when we already have languages like C++, Java, and Haskell?
<li> Compare and contrast five different scripting languages.  How are they different and for what tasks might each be best for?
