<p>
There are multiple ways to process arrays. In a language
like Haskell, where recursion is the main control mechanism, there are
two ways that you should be familar with.

<p>
<H3>Linear, item by item, processing.</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Scan over the elements from lowest to highest.
<li> Write a pair of functions.
	<ol> <LI> A <I>wrapper function</I> that computes the bounds of the array, and then calls the worker with the bounds as arguments.
	     <li> A <I>worker function</I> that recurses over the the two bounds.
	            <ul> <li> The <I>base case</I> is when the lower bound becomes larger than the upper bound.
	                 <li> A <I>step case</I> where the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound. This case consists of at least two actions
	                         <ol> <li> Perform some action based upon the lower bound
	                              <li> Make a recursive call which increments the lower bound but which leaves the upper bound unchanged.
	                 </ul>             </ol>
    </ol>
<li> The wrapper function usually has 2 or three actions.
   <ol> <li> Compute the bounds of the array (and possibly other initialization actions).
        <li> Calls the workewr function
        <li> Performs some clean up actions
   </ol>
</ul>
<p>
<H5>Example linear scan. Printing each element of an array.</H5>
<p>
<pre>
printEach :: Show a => Array a -> IO ()       -- write a contract
printEach a =                                 -- define the wrapper
  do { (low,high) <- boundsArr a              -- compute the bounds
     ; worker (low,high) a                    -- call the worker
     ; return ()                              -- clean up
     }

worker (low,high) a | low > high = return ()  -- base case
worker (low,high) a =                         -- step case has 2 actions
  do { item <- readArr a low                  -- 1) an action based upon low
     ; print item
     ; worker (low+1,high) a                  -- 2) make a recursive call
     }
</pre>


<p>
<H3>Index pre-computation, and scan over index list.
</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The design recipe has two parts
       <ol> <li> <I>Index calculation</I>, where we compute a list of indexes.
            <li> <I>Index scanning</I>, where we scan over the list performing an action for each index.
       </ol>
<li> Each part can correspond to either a separate function, or separate actions. This is the designers choice.
<li> The two parts are then sequenced by using a "do" command.
<li> Note that index calculation can often be wriiten with a simple list creating operation, like a sequence or comprehension.
<li> Scanning is just a simple recursive function over the structure of lists
        <ol> <li> Like many such list functions it has two cases
             <li> When the index list is empty
             <li> When the index list has the shape (x:xs). In this case
                  perform an action and make a recursive call.
        <ol>
</ul>
<H5>An example of index precalculation</H5>
<p>
<pre>
revIndexes :: (Int,Int) -> [(Int,Int)]
revIndexes (low,high) = zip countup countdown          -- Part 1, index precalculation
  where n = high - low + 1
        half = n `div` 2
        countup = [low..half]
        countdown = [high, high -1 .. low]

rev5 :: Array a -> IO ()
rev5 a =
  do { (low,high) <- boundsArr a
     ; let scan :: [(Int,Int)] -> IO ()               -- Part 2, defining scanning
           scan [] = return ()                        -- base case of scan
           scan ((i,j):xs) =                          -- step with 2 actions
              do { swap a (i,j); scan xs }
     ; scan (revIndexes (low,high))                   -- calling the scan step
     }
</pre>
