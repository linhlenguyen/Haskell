see who had a hand in shaping my world.
<hr>
<B>New april 29, 2011.</B> There is <STRONG>new release</STRONG> of the <STRONG>Omega interpreter</STRONG>.

I gave a lecture about the Lambda Calculus as a guest lecturer for
Jim Hook's "Theory of Computation" class. To illustrate my talk
I wrote a little Haskell program I call the Lambda Caculator. It was so much
fun, the students wanted to try it out. Read about it and download it <A HREF="LamCalc/index.html">here</A>.

<hr>

<STRONG>"Generalized Algebraic Data
Structures"</STRONG> have become a a hot new topic. They have recently been added to the GHC compiler.
They support the construction,
maintenance, and propagation of semantic properties of
programs using powerful old ideas about types (the
Curry-Howard Isomorphism) in surprisingly easy to understand
new ways. The language <A HREF="Omega/index.html">Omega</A> was designed and implemented to demonstrate their utility.
Here a a few talks I gave that explains how they work.

<UL>
        <LI> September 2004. The first is a talk in which I explained them at the
         <a href="OmegaHaskellWkShp.htm"> Haskell Workshop in Snow Bird Utah.</a>
         </LI>
        <LI> October 2004. The second is a set of <A HREF="papers/PSUseminarOct2004.ppt">notes</A> from a seminar talk at Portland State University about
         similar material, but aimed at an audience with less functional
         programming knowledge.
         </LI>
    <LI> November 2004. The third is my OOPSLA Onward Session Talk:
         <A HREF="papers/OmegaLangOfFutOnwardOct04.ppt">Languages of the Future</A>
         This talk requires even less functional programming background and
         is probably the most accessible set of slides. The companion
         <A HREF="papers/LangOfTheFuture.ps">paper</A>
         contains an even more detailed explanation </LI>
</UL>

<B>Research Interests</B>
<p>
<p>
I was the General Chair of the <A HREF="http://www.program-transformation.org/Gpce">Generative Programming and Component Engineering
Conference</A> (GPCE'04). Co-located with OOPSLA'04, October 24-28, 2004.
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

<p>
I organized the <A HREF="http://cs.pdx.edu/~sheard/2002IcfpContest/">5th ICFP programming contest</A> (2002)
and the <A HREF="http://icfpcontest.org/">11th ICFP programming contest</A> (2008).



<p>
<BIG>I am the creator of MetaML</BIG> See the
<A HREF="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/projects/metaml/index.html">homepage</A>
for download and installation instructions.

<p>
I am actively pursuing research in the design, implementation, and application of
dependently typed programming languages. I view <A HREF="Omega/index.html">Omega</A> as a first attempt.
I am working with <A HREF="http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~astump/">Aaron Stump</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/">Stephanie Weirich</A> to combine
some of ideas and experience. See <A HREF="http://www.trellys.org/">http://www.trellys.org/</A>


<p>
 I am actively pursuing research in the design, implementation, and application of
 meta-programming systems. I have written a
 <A HREF="staged.html">taxonomy</A> of meta-programming systems, and has built the
 meta-programming language
 <A href="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/projects/metaml/index.html">MetaML</A>,
 and designed the <A HREF="http://www.haskell.org/th/">Template Haskell</A> extension to the Glasgow Haskell compiler.
 I am also interested in applying
 <A HREF="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/projects/Mustang/Overview.html">
 meta-programming systems</A> to
 domain specific languages</A>.





 <p>
 To see what I've thought about in the not
 too distant past, read a few of the NSF proposals I submitted a few years ago.
