assigned Tuesday Jan. 18, 2005                 due in class Tuesday Jan. 25, 2005

NOTE - THIS IS AN HTML FILE which contains HTML TAGS TO DISPLAY METAML CODE PROPERLY

1) Consider the function append : 'a list -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list

fun append [] ys = ys
  | append (x::xs) ys = x :: (append xs ys);

A) write two new versions with the staged types:

appendA : 'a list -&gt; &lt;'a list&gt; -&gt; &lt;'a list&gt;
appendB : &lt;'a list&gt; -&gt; 'a list -&gt; &lt;'a list&gt;

B) Discuss the utility of the two staged versions. How do they differ. Does one lend it self
to staging more than the other?

C) Is the lift annotation usefull? Compare the types printed by MetaML when
using lift, and when not using lift. Are they different? When will lift not be usefull?

D) Write a staged version which is a generator (rather than a code transformer) with type
   appendC :: 'a list -&gt; &lt; 'a list -&gt; 'a list &gt;.  Use the techniques discussed in class,
   but don't use the trick which looks like:  &lt;fn x =&gt; ~(bodyFun &lt;x&gt;) &gt;  where bodyfun
   is a code transformer.

2) Consider a simple expresion language for regular expressions,
whose abstract syntax is given by the MetaML datatype definition:

datatype RE =
   Lit of string      (* (Lit s) exactly the string s          *)
 | Or of (RE*RE)      (* (Or (a,b)) either a or b              *)
 | Concat of (RE*RE)  (* (Concat (a,b)) a followed by b        *)
 | Star of RE         (* (Star z) zero or more occurences of z *)

data 'a Maybe = Just of 'a | Nothing

the meaning of a regular expression is a function with type:
  string -> Maybe(string*string).

Suppose the function "f" encodes the meaning of the regular expression
val r1 = Or(Lit "tim",Star (Concat (Lit "a",Lit "b")))
then

f "tim123"       --->  Just ("tim","123")
f "xyz"          --->  Just ("","xyz")        i.e. Zero occurrences
f "abababtom"    --->  Just ("ababab","tom")

a) write a function eval :: RE -> String -> Maybe(String,String)
that translates a RE to its meaning.  (hint: first write a function
prefix :: string -> string -> Maybe String such that
  prefix "abc" "xyz"     ---> Nothing
  prefix "abc" "abc123"  ---> Just "123" )

b) Write a new staged version of "eval" called "eval2" with type
eval2 :: RE -&gt; &lt;string&gt;  -&gt; &lt;(string*string)Maybe&gt;
