<H4>Room Change</H4>
<p>
<STRONG>CS 457 and CS 557 (functional languages)
has had a last minute snafu in room scheduling.
The web lists CH263 (Cramer Hall 263) but this is
in error. The class will meet instead in ED202
(Education building 202) which appears at the coordinates
F-7 in the <A HREF="http://www.pdx.edu/campus-map">map</A>.
This is on Harrison between 6th and Broadway.</STRONG>
