<H3>Goals</H3>
<p>
The purpose of this worksheet is to practice creating music using Haskeore.
We will focus on transcribing small pieces of music from a written score
(sheet music) into a Haskore program.
<p>
<H3>What to do</H3>
<ul>
<li> Get and install the Haskore Libraries from Hackage <A HREF="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/haskore-vintage-0.1">haskore-vintage</A> using <A HREF="../Notes/Cabal.pdf">cabal</A>.

<li> Understand written music notation (sheet music)
<li> Transcribe "Row Your Boat" into Haskore
    <ol>
    <li> Use the guide below
    <li> Think carefully about how to create a "triplet" for the
         parts of the song with lyrics "mer-ri-ly"
    <li> See some <A HREF="../Doc/SampleMusicCode.html">sample transcriptions</A> for a C-Scale.
    </ol>
<li> Modify the music to create a round.
<li> Play your music at different tempos
<li> Play your music so each part of the round uses a different instrument.
  <ol>
    <li> <A HREF="MidiInstrumentList.html">What instuments are there?</A>
    </ol>
<li> Find sheet music for a song of your choice from the internet, and transcribe
a part of it.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>Your code will start something like:</H3>
