<p>
GHC is available on both the linuxlab Linux machines located in FAB 88-09 and
on the sunrays connected to chandra.cs.pdx.edu in the UNIX Lab (FAB 88-10).
<p>
On the linuxlab machines students need not do anything to get access to the
GHC toolchain. It is in your PATH by default and will just work. On the UNIX
Lab machine(s) you will need to run `addpkg` in a terminal, select GHC, then
log out and log back in. Once this is done GHC will be in your path and
available for use. Note that there are many useful applications available to
students from the addpkg utility on both UNIX and Linux. To use them this
process may be followed. Simply run `addpkg`, select your application, then
log in and log out so that the changes may propogate.

<p>
Linuxlab machines are available remotely by ssh'ing to linuxlab.cs.pdx.edu
and the UNIX lab machine(s) are available remotely by ssh'ing to
unix.cs.pdx.edu. All logins (remote and physical) will require CS student
computing accounts which can be obtained from the CS Tutors in FAB 88. Physical
access to the labs is access restricted and requires a proximity badge which
can be obtained from NH's ID Services windows. Once a badge is acquired, access
needs to be requested from the CS Tutors in FAB 88. Badge access requests may
take up to a week to process.
<p>
When using the UNIX or Linux machines it is often useful to be able to access
files on one system from another. On both sets of systems you may access your
home directory files for each system by using the following paths:<BR>
<B>/home/linux/your_username </B> <BR>
for your Linux home directory and <BR>
<B>/home/unix/your_username</B> <BR>for your UNIX home directory. Note that both paths are
valid on both sets of systems. More details on this process can be found on the
CAT <A HREF="http://www.cat.pdx.edu/linux/cs-linux-lab.html
<p>">website</A>:
If needing to copy files to/from Linux/UNIX students may find scp and sftp
useful. Winscp and putty's sftp client are available for Windows users. Fugu
and CyberDuck are available to Mac OS X users. Linux users can use the command
line scp and sftp commands.
