In this homework I am asking you to do something creative with either
the bitmapped graphics (PPM6.hs) or the music (Haskore) packages.

<p>
You will need to download and install the correct libraries

<ul>
<li> For music, Get and install the Haskore Library. Get it from Hackage <A HREF="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/haskore-vintage-0.1">haskore-vintage</A>.
See <A HREF="../Notes/Cabal.pdf">How to install a Hackage package using Cabal</A> if you're
not familar with this.

<li> For graphics you will need to download the two files
      <A HREF="../Lib/PPM6.hs">PPM6.hs</A> and <A HREF="../Lib/Colour.hs">Colour.hs</A> and place them in same directory as your program.
</ul>

<p>
By "creative", I expect you to create some aesthetic artifact, either music
or graphics picture. I will grade it using the following rubric
<p>
<ul>
<li> Is the source a well structured functional program?
<li> Is the result aesthetically pleasing?
<li> Does the program exercise the full spectrum of possibilities
explained in the lectures (uses many of the operators rather than just 1 or 2).
<li> Has the author added some thing new?
  <ol>
    <li> For example, in music you might use the NoteAtrributes to control
         loudness, or define operators to fade in and out, or
         operators to dynamically shift from one key to another.
   <li> In graphics, one might define BitMaps for other shapes or transformations.
   </ol>
<li> Is the code well documented
<li> If the student is called upon in class, can the student explain
  how his program works?

</ul>
<p>
You can turn in your homework on <A HREF="d2l.pdx.edu">D2L</A>, by Monday, October 26. You should include
two attachments:
<ol>
<li> The haskell source file of the program you wrote.
<ul>
   <LI> Include your name at the top of the file as a comment. -- Name of programmer:
   <LI> Include an email where you want comments sent. -- Email to send comments to:
</ul>
<li> One or more files you created that illustrates your result. These
will be .ppm files (for graphics) or .mid files (for music).
</ol>

<p>
On Monday, October 26, 2015, we will look at (or listen to!) some of the results

<p>
Good Luck!, I am looking forward to the results!
