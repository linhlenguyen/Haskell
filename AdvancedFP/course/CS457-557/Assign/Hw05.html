In this homework we ask you to prove a few things using equational
reasoning and induction, and to use the HUnit and QuickCheck
tesing frameworks.
<p>
1) Prove the following property:
   map f x ++ map f y = map f (x ++ y).
   Use the following steps:
<ol>
<li> Take a look at the <A HREF="../Notes/induction.html">notes</A> about proving things by induction.
<li> List all the definitions and equations you use.
<li> Label each with a name
<li> Set up the structure of the proof
<li> label each step with the label of the definition
     or equation that justifes it.
</ol>
<p>

2) Pick an example from the <A HREF="../Exercise/LawsWorksheet.txt">Laws Worksheet</A> we looked at on
   Tuesday February 2, and prove it by induction (Be sure you don't choose one
   discussed in the <A HREF="../Notes/induction.html">notes</A> on induction).
   If it requires a helper lemma, prove the helper lemma as well.

<p>
3) Using the same example from the
  <A HREF="../Exercise/LawsWorksheet.txt">Laws Worksheet</A>
  construct a program that uses QuickCheck to randomly test that law.

<p>
4) Go back to <A HREF="Hw03.lhs">Homework 3</A>.
<UL>
<li> Add HUnit testing assertions that create at least 10 tests for either
the "add" or "mul" function, and could be used as
a regression testing suite. Make sure your program passes all your tests. Document
this and turn this in.
<li> Modify your program so it uses another algorithm to compute "add" or "mul", Validate
that it still passes all the unit tests.
</ul>
<p>
5) Put all this in one file that is an executable Haskell program, This means the proofs
will have to be in comments.
<p>
