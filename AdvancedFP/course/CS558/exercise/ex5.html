<H3>Content of reading exercise #5</H3>

<ol>

<li> What are some of the drawbacks of parametric polymorphism?
<li> Discuss some of the ways that generics are implemented.
<li> What is the difference between a generic subroutine and a macro?  Why prefer one over the other?
<li> What is the main purpose of having generic subroutines and classes in a language?
<li> Give an example, not mentioned in the text, of a case where a generic subroutine or class would be useful.  Can you write the code for this example in Java, C++, or C#?
<li> How do Haskell type classes support generic programming?  (Note: you may need to look this up online)
<li> If you were writing your own compiler, how would you deal with generic classes?  In what way would you decide how to store instances of a generic class in memory? How might allowing generic classes in your language impact your type system implementation?
