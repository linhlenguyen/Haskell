<ol>

<li>Explain how can we be sure that a subroutines lexically surrounding routine is active even if the subroutine was not called directly by the surrounding routine.
<li>During a subroutine call and execution, which tasks are handled by the caller and which are handled by the callee?  Why do you think these tasks are divided in this way?
<li>In the calling conventions for MIPS and x86 processors, what kinds of things are typically stored in caller-saves and callee-saves registers?
<li>Compare and contrast the differences in the RISC and CISC calling conventions.  What do you think the reasons are for these differences?
<li>How does in-line expansion work and what are its advantages/disadvantages?
<li>Explain how the call-by-reference, call-by-value, call-by-value/result, and call-by-sharing work.  Why might each of these conventions be used?
<li>When and why is it necessary to pass a closure as a parameter?
<li>What are the three types of operations that exception handlers tend to perform?
<li>How do exception handlers in imperative and functional languages differ?
</ol>
