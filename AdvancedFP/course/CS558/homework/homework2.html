<H1>Imperative Language interpretor.</H1>

Consider a simple language of imperative expressions, which we'll
call E2. We will store programs in this language in files with extension *.e2.
It's concretized abstract syntax is given by the following extended
grammar:


<PRE>
prog := exp
exp := var
| int
| '(' ':=' var exp ')'
| '(' 'while' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'if' exp exp exp ')'
| '(' 'write' exp ')'
| '(' 'block' { exp } ')'
| '(' '+' exp exp ')'
| '(' '-' exp exp ')'
| '(' '*' exp exp ')'
| '(' '/' exp exp ')'
| '(' '<=' exp exp ')'
var := <I>string of letters</I>
</PRE

<p>
As before, comments may be included by enclosing them between
comment braces '{-' and '-}' and they may be nested.
<p>

An informal semantics for E2 is as follows. The evaluation of each
expression (and hence of a program) yields a single integer result.

<ul>

<Li>A variable <B>x </B>yields its current value. Every variable is
implicitly initialized to 0 at the beginning of program evaluation. <p>

<li>An integer <B>i</B> (like 5 or 782) yields itself. <p>


<li> Evaluating the assignment expression <B>(:= x e)</B> evaluates e ,
assigns the resulting value into variable x, and yields that value. <p>

<li> Evaluating <B>(while e1 e2)</B> repeatedly performs the following
steps: e 1 is evaluated; if the result is non-zero e 2 is evaluated;
otherwise, the evaluation of the while is complete. A while
expression always yields the value 0. <p>

<li> Evaluating <B>(if e1 e2 e3)</B> evaluates e1; if the result is
non-zero, then e2 is evaluated and resulting value is yielded as the
value of the if expression; otherwise, e3 is evaluated and the
resulting value is yielded as the value of the if expression. <p>


<li> Evaluating <B>(write e)</B> evaluates e, prints the resulting value
(following by a newline) to standard output, and yields that value. <p>


<li> Evaluating <B>(block e1 e2 ... en)</B> evaluates e1 , e2 ,. . . , en
in that order, and yields the value of en . If n = 0, the block
expression yields 0. <p>

<li> Evaluating <B>(+ e1 e2)</B> evaluates e1 and e2 and yields the sum
of their values. The other arithmetic operations are similar. <p>

<li> Evaluating <B>(<= e1 e2)</B> evaluates e1 and e2 , and compares
their values. If the first is less than or equal to the second, the
expression yields 1; otherwise it yields 0. <p>

</ul>
<p>

An example program
<A HREF="../code/hw2/primes.e2">primes.e2</A>
written in this language is available for you to view.

<p> Two E2 interpreters have been provided, one in Python ( <A HREF="../code/hw2/Hw2.py">Hw2.py</A> )
and the other in Haskell ( <A HREF="../code/hw2/Hw2.hs">Hw2.hs</A> ).


<p>
Each interpreter reads a file containing an E2 program in the syntax described
above, echoes the program (to confirm correct parsing), evaluates the program (possibly
producing output from
write
expressions), and displays the evaluation result.
<p>
The Python
program interprets the abstract syntax directly. The Haskell program first translates it into
stack machine code (for an extended and somewhat different version of the stack machine
from Homework 1), prints out the stack code (for debugging purposes), and then executes
it.  For example, here is a trace from inside GHCI on the file <A HREF="../code/hw2/count.e2">count.e2</A>

<PRE>
*Main> interp "count.e2"
Expression:
(block (:= n 1)
       (while (<= n 2) (block (write n) (:= n (+ n 1)) ))
       )
Compiles to:
[Const 1, Dup, Store n, Pop, Label 0:, Const 2, Load n, Swap, Leq,
 Branchz 1, Load n, Dup, Print, Pop, Const 1, Load n, Plus, Dup,
 Store n, Pop, Branch 0, Label 1:, Const 0]
Executing:

1
2

Evaluates to: 0
</PRE>


<p> For more debugging help, you can trace the behavior of the stack
machine by typing "<B>trace</B>" at the GHCI prompt, This commnad
flips the state of the tracing flag. <A HREF="hw2Trace.txt">Here</A> is a transcript of
turing the trace on and reexecuting <A HREF="../code/hw2/count.e2">count.e2</A>.
One should do this before executing the Haskell function <B>interp</B> to
start the read-eval-print function.
<p>

One can also control
tracing programatically by using the IO action
<B>writeIORef trace_on True</B> inside a Haskell function with type
IO.
<p>
<H3>What you need to do.</H3>
<ol>
<li>One of the interpreters evaluates the operands to binary
operators ( + , - , * , / , and <= ) from left-to-right; the other from
right-to-left. Write an example E2 program, not involving write
statements, that produces diffierent answers depending on the order of
evaluation of these operands, and hence diffierent for the two
interpreters. Put your program in file sol2A.e2 and and submit this
file. Your program must include a comment stating: which interpreter has
which behavior; and based on this program, what (if anything) can be
deduced about the order of evaluation of operands in the Python and
Haskell languages themselves. (20 points)


<p>

<li>

Modify
each
interpreter to support a new kind of expression, as specified below. Some of the code for
parsing these expressions is already present; what you need to do is extend the abstract
syntax, add printing code, and add evaluation code (in Python) or compilation code (in
Haskell). When modifying the Haskell version don't change or add to the stack machine.

<p>
The
for
expression has the following syntax:
exp := '(' 'for' var exp exp exp ')'

<p> Evaluating (for x e1 e2 e3 ) first evaluates e1 to a value v1
and stores v1 into x . It then repeats the following steps: evaluate e2
to a value v2 ; fetch x ; if x > v2 then terminate
evaluation of the for, yielding the value 0; otherwise, evaluate e3 and
discard the yielded result, fetch x , add one to it, store back into x ,
and repeat.

<p>
When modifying the code, study carefully how the "while" statement is implemented.
Look for how "while" statements are parsed, how they are evaluated (in python) and how they are
translated to stack machine code (in Haskell). This will be a good guide for modifying
the code to add "for" statements.  Searching for "while" and 'While' in the source will help identify
places in the code where things neeed to be added or modified.

<p>
For example,
<p>
(for i 1 10 (write i))

<p> prints the numbers from 1 to 10, and yields the value 0. Make sure
you get the order of evaluation right. For example, the bizarre program
<p>
<B>(for i i (block (:= i (+ i 2)) 10) (block (write i) (:= i (+ i 3))))</B>

<p>
prints out the numbers 2,8 and yields the value 0. Hints: Model your code
on the existing code for while. The Haskell version may require some
tricky stack manipulation to get the order of evaluation right; once
again, you may find the SWAP instruction useful.

<p> Put your revised Python interpreter in sol2B.py (30 points), and your revised
Haskell interpreter in sol2B.hs (30 points), and submit both these files.


<H1>Axiomatic Semantics</H1>



Consider the very simple language used to illustrate axiomatic semantics
in lecture. Suppose we add a non-deterministic guarded if statement to
our language. The syntax of this statement is


<PRE>
gif E1 -> S1
| E2 -> S2
...
| En -> Sn
end
</PRE>

<p> where the Ei are boolean expressions. This statement is executed by
non-deterministically choosing any one i such that Ei evaluates to true,
and executing the corresponding Si . Among other things, this statement
gives an elegant, symmetric way to express functions like max , e.g.

<PRE>
gif x1 >= x2 -> max := x1
|   x2 >= x1 -> max := x2
end
</PRE>

<p> Note that if x1 = x2 then either branch might be chosen
non-deterministically. In this example, the resulting value of max will be
the same either way, but we can also write guarded <B>gif</B>'s that are
intentionally non-determinstic, e.g., to simulate a coin toss:


<PRE>
gif true -> coin := 0
| true -> coin := 1
end  { coin }
</PRE>


This question has two parts. Type your answers to both parts into a file
sol2C.txt, and submit this file.

<ol>

<li> Extend the axiomatic semantics given in lecture by writing down an appropriate rule of
inference (GIF) for
gif
statements. (5 points)

<li> Derive the following triple, by presenting a formal proof tree for it (as shown in lecture).

<PRE>
{ z < 0 }
while (x > -5) do
gif x <= 0 -> y := -x
| x >= 0 -> y := x
end;
z := z - y
end
{ z < 0 }
</PRE>
(15 points)
</ol>

<p> Remember to label each node in the tree with the appropriate axiom or
rule of inference. You'll need one (WHILE), one (COMP), one (GIF), three
(ASSIGN), and four (CONSEQ) steps. Don't worry about formatting your
answer beautifully, so long as it is clear.
