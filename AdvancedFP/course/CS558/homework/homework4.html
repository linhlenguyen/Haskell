Questions in this homework are based upon two different languages. The first part (A)
is based upon the E3 language from Homework 3. The second part (B) is based upon
the language E4 (which is like E3 with 'local'; constructs for characters; and constructs for
raising and handling exceptions). Its "concretized" abstract syntax is given by the
following grammar:

<PRE>
prog := '(' { def } ')' exp
def := globaldef | fundef
globaldef := '(' 'global' var exp ')'
fundef := '(' 'fun' fname '(' { var } ')' exp ')'
exp := var
| int
| '(' ':=' var exp ')'
| '(' 'while' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'if' exp exp exp ')'
| '(' 'write' exp ')'
| '(' 'block' { exp } ')'
| '(' '@' fname { exp } ')'
| '(' '+' exp exp ')'
| '(' '-' exp exp ')'
| '(' '*' exp exp ')'
| '(' '/' exp exp ')'
| '(' '<=' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'pair' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'fst' exp ')'
| '(' 'snd' exp ')'
| '(' 'ispair' exp ')'

| '(' 'local' '(' { var exp } ')' exp ')'
| '(' 'try' exp { '(' '@' hname { exp } exp ')' } ')'
| '(' 'raise'  hname { exp } ')'

| char
|  '(' '=' exp exp ')'
|  '(' 'ischar' exp ')'


fname := letter { letter | digit }
var := letter { letter | digit }
hname := letter { letter | digit }
</PRE>

<p>

As before, comments may be included by enclosing them between comment braces '{-' and
'-}' characters, and they may be nested.

<p>

<ul>

<li> <H3>Part A - Parameter passing mechanisms.</H3>
<p> Part A has two parts. The first where you write E3 programs that
distinguish the different parameter passing mechanisms. The second where
you alter the call by reference interpreter to pass reference for expressions
of the form <B>(fst e)</B> and <B>(snd e)</B>.
<ol>
<li> <H4>Distinguishing different parameter passing mechanisms (30 points).</H4>
<p>
There are three different pairings of parameter passing mechanisms
 <ul>
   <li> call-by-value v.s. call-by-reference  ( <B>sol4A1.e3</B> )
   <li> call-by-reference v.s. call-by-value-return ( <B>sol4A2.e3</B> )
   <Li> call-by-value-return v.s. call-by-value ( <B>sol4A3.e3</B> )
 </ul>
<p> For each of the pairings write a single *.e3 program whose main body
gives a different answer when run under the two interpreters. Name
your programs as indicated in the pairings above, and submit these files
in D2L.
<p>
To test your files you must download all three interpreters, and run each of your programs
through the appropriate pair to see that your E3 program gets a different result.
<p>

<li> <H4>Altering call by reference (40 points).</H4>
<p> Your goal for this part is to alter the call by reference <A HREF="../code/hw4/hw4ref.hs">interpreter</A>
so that parameters to functions of the form form <B>(fst e)</B> and <B>(snd e)</B>
are passed by reference. For example consider the program.

<pre>
(global x 5)
(global p (pair 8 2))
(fun swap (x y) (local (temp x) (block (:= temp x) (:= x y) (:= y temp))))
</pre>
Now observe a session for the read eval print loop. Note the call
<B>(@ swap x (fst p))</B>, both paremeters to <B>swap</B> are locations on the heap.
One is a variable, and the other is the first part of a pair.
<pre>
enter Exp>
x
5
enter Exp>
p
(8.2)@2
enter Exp>
(@ swap x (fst p))
5
enter Exp>
x
8
enter Exp>
p
(5.2)@2
</pre>
The interpreter already special cases arguments in function
calls that are variables (like <B>x</B>). Your job is to special case
expressions of the form <B>(fst e)</B> and <B>(snd e)</B>. The code
has some commented out stubs in the right place
to get you started.
<p>
<H4>What to do</H4>
<ol>
 <li> Take your copy of the call be reference interpreter <A HREF="../code/hw4/Hw4ref.hs">Hw4ref.hs</A> and make
 a copy with the name <B>sol4A.hs</B>.
 <li> Alter this copy by replacing the comments near line 212. These lines are inside the interpreter case
 for function application, ie. E3 expressions like <BIG>(@ f x1 x2 x3)</BIG>
 which inside Haskell parse as <BIG>(At "f" [Var "x1",Var "x2", Var "x3"])</BIG>. The code in this interpreter
 uses call by reference for variables. Your job is to make arguments like these <B>(@ f (fst x) (snd y))</B>
 also be passed by reference.
 <li> Create some tests and test your result. You can use the example above as one test, but you should create and use some others as well.
 <li> Turn in the file <B>sol4A.hs</B> into D2L.
</ol>

</ol>




<li> <H3>Part B - Exceptions (40 points).</H3>
<p> The file <A HREF="../code/hw4/Hw4.hs">Hw4.hs</A> is a Haskell interpreter for the E4 language.
The E4 language is much like the E3 language but it adds the following constructs to the
concretized abstract syntax.

<pre>
exp := ...
| '(' 'local' '(' { var exp } ')' exp ')'
| '(' 'try' exp { '(' '@' hname { exp } exp ')' } ')'
| '(' 'raise'  hname { exp } ')'

| char
|  '(' '=' exp exp ')'
|  '(' 'ischar' exp ')'
</pre>
<p>
The language E4 adds character constants like <B>'c'</B> and <B>'z'</B> and <B>'5'</B> to the atoms of the language.
One can compare characters for equality by using the <B>=</B> operation. For example <B>(= 'c' 'd')</B> would
return <B>0</B>  (for false) and <B>(= 'c' 'c')</B> would return <B>1</B> (for true). It is an error
to apply <B>=</B> to non-characters. In particular <B>=</B> does <EM>not work</EM> on integer atoms.
<p>
The other constructs of E4 concern raising and handling exceptions. The raise construct takes a exception name
(using the same syntax as variables and function names) and an arbitrary number of arguments.
For example one might write <B>(+ 4 (raise nogood 4 'x'))</B>.
Here the second argument to <B>+</B> raises the <B>nogood</B> exception with the arguments <B>4</B> and <B>'x'</B>.
Raising an exception will cause the whole expression to abort. For example if we type this expression
in the read-eval-print loop we get the following transcrition.
<p>
<pre>
enter Exp>
(+ 4 (raise nogood 4 'x'))
Uncaught exception: nogood 4 'x'
</pre>
<p>
If we turn tracing on, and type an expression, we can watch the execution of the expression
as the exception is raised.
<p>
<pre>
enter Exp>
trace
Tracing is on.
enter Exp>
(+ 4 (* 3 (raise nogood 4 'x')))
> (+ 4 (* 3 (raise nogood 4 'x')))
  Stack 0@[('c'.4),('a'.9),('b'.12)] 1@[3,'a',6,'d']
 |> 4
    Stack 0@[('c'.4),('a'.9),('b'.12)] 1@[3,'a',6,'d']
 |< 4
 |> (* 3 (raise nogood 4 'x'))
    Stack 0@[('c'.4),('a'.9),('b'.12)] 1@[3,'a',6,'d']
 | |> 3
      Stack 0@[('c'.4),('a'.9),('b'.12)] 1@[3,'a',6,'d']
 | |< 3
 | |> (raise nogood 4 'x')
      Stack 0@[('c'.4),('a'.9),('b'.12)] 1@[3,'a',6,'d']
 | | |> 4
        Stack 0@[('c'.4),('a'.9),('b'.12)] 1@[3,'a',6,'d']
 | | |< 4
 | | |> 'x'
        Stack 0@[('c'.4),('a'.9),('b'.12)] 1@[3,'a',6,'d']
 | | |< 'x'
 | |< Exception nogood 4 'x'
 |< Exception nogood 4 'x'
< Exception nogood 4 'x'
Uncaught exception: nogood 4 'x'
</pre>

<p>
Notice everything proceeds normally until the raise inside the deeply nested call to *. Once the
raise is executed all the nested computations are aborted (we sometime say they unwind).
<p>
Exceptions would be of little use, except for error reporting, if we could not catch a raised exception.
That is done with the try construct. The form of the try construct is
<B>(try <I>test</I> <I>handle1</I> <I>handle2</I> ... <I>handleN</I>)</B>. The semantics is to execute
the <I>test</I>. If that executes normally, then the value of the try is that value. If the test
raises an exception then the handles are tried from left to right. The form of a handle is
<B>(@ name <I>param1</I> ... <I>paramN</I> <I>body</I>)</B>. The first handle with the
matching exception name, and the correct number of parameters wins. The body of that
handle is executed and its value is returned by the try. Note that the
parameters of the handle are bound to the arguments of the exception.
If no handle matches, the exception is propogated.
<p>
For example, we might extend our traced example by typing.
<p>
<pre>
enter Exp>
(+ 4 (try (* 3 (raise nogood 4 'x')) (@ nogood n c (+ n 3))))
11
enter Exp>
(+ 4 (try (* 3 (raise nogood 4 'x')) (@ nogoode n c (+ n 3))))
Uncaught exception: nogood 4 'x'
</pre>
Here, the trys have only one handle. In the first example, it matches the raised exception, so the body of
handle (+ n 3) is returned as the value of the try (rather than the * expression which
aborted). Note that the parameters <B>n</B> and <B>c</B> are bound to the exception arguments
<B>4</B> and <B>'x'</B>. In the second example, the raised exception and the handler have different names
to the exception is just passed on.
<p>
Note that in these examples the raise expression is statically
inside the try statement, but this need not be case. In fact the raise could be
deeply nested inside some function calls used in the test of the try.

<p>
The goal of this part of the homework is to write the function sum that sums up all the elements
in a value. For example, if the global variable <B>x</B> was the deeply nested set of pairs <B>((3.5).((6.7).(8.1)))</B>
the expression <B>(@ sum x)</B> would evaluate to <B>30</B>. The complicated part
is to handle deeply nested pairs that contain characters like: <B>((3.('a'.'c')).((8.12).(3.1)))</B>.
To handle characters we will use a table that maps Char to Int like: (('c'.4).(('a'.9).(('b'.12).0))).
Such tables will use the encoding of lists we saw in <A HREF="../code/hw3/lists.e3">homework 3</A>.
<p>
<H4>What to do.</H4>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Create a file <B>sol4B.e4</B> which will be an E4 program. That program will have at least
the following definitions.
  <ul>
    <li> A global <B>table </B>that maps the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' to Integers. The table should
         be in the list format we used in <A HREF="../code/hw3/lists.e3">homework 3</A>.
    <li> A function <B>find</B> that looks up a character in <B>table</B>. A call like <B>(@ find c table)</B>
         will return the value mapped to <B>c</B> in <B>table </B>if there is one. If one
         is not found in <B>table</B>, find should <B>raise</B> an exception. For example:
         <pre>
         enter Exp>
         (@ find 'c' table)
         4
         enter Exp>
         (@ find 'z' table)
         Uncaught exception: notfound 'z'
         </pre>
    <li> A function <B>sum</B>. That adds up a value. This function will use the function
         <B>find</B> when it encounters a character.
    <li> A function <B>sum2</B> (see below) that uses exceptions differently from <B>sum</B>
  </ul>

<li> As a first attempt to writing <B>sum</B>, do not use any <B>try</B> statements. Just call <B>find</B>
    as if it always returns an integer value. This function should raise an uncaught exception
    for unfound characters. I strongly suggest you write this
         function recursively. You will need to use the operations <B>ispair</B> and <B>ischar</B>.

<li> In your second attempt add a <B>try</B> statement that catches exceptions inside calls to <B>find</B>. The handler
     should return 0 if the character is not in the table.

<li> Be sure and test all kinds of values, containing deeply nested pairs, integers, and characters.

<li> Finally make a variation of the <B>sum</B> function called <B>sum2</B>. This function
     takes two arguments <B>(fun sum2 (n x) ...)</B>. Where <B>n</B> is an integer and <B>x</B> is an arbitrary value.
     As before, the idea is to sum
     up the argument <B>x</B>.
     <p>
     The argument <B>n</B> counts the nesting depth of the argument <B>x</B>.
     This is easy to do, every time <B>sum2</B> makes a recursive call, add <B>1</B> to <B>n</B>, i.e.
     <B>(@ sum (+ n 1)</B> ...) . The purpose of this nesting counter, is that whenever an exception is handled,
     the handler should return the value of the nesting depth as the value of the handle (In <B>sum</B>, we always returned 0, when we
     handled an exception).
<p> Here is an example transcript demonstrating how <B>sum2</B> should work.

<pre>
enter Exp>
(@ sum2 0 'z')
0
enter Exp>
(@ sum2 0 (pair 0 'z'))
1
enter Exp>
(@ sum2 0 (pair 0 (pair 0 'z')))
2
enter Exp>
(@ sum2 0 (pair 0 (pair 0 (pair 0 'z'))))
3
</pre>
<li> Be sure and submit your file <B>sol4B.e4</B> in D2L.
</ol>

</ul>
