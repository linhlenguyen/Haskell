All programs mentioned can be downloaded from the this document
<ul><li> <A HREF="../code/hw6/Hw6.hs">Hw6.hs</A>. A definitional interpreter (in Haskell) for language E6.
<li>  <A HREF="../code/hw6/typedlists.e6">typedlists.e6</A>. A sample E6 program.
<li> <A HREF="../code/hw6/badprog.e6">badprog.e6</A>. A sample program with a type error.

</ul>

<p>

Consider a typed variant of our familiar simple language with imperative
expressions, functions, and integers, characters, booleans, pairs, and lists.
We'll call this language E6. It is very similar to language <A HREF="homework3.html">E3</A>, except
it is typed, and it supports booleans, characters and lists as primitive
values. We do <B>not</B> encode booleans as integers or encode
lists as right-nested pairs, as we did in <A HREF="homework3.html">E3</A>. Instead there
are primitive operations for each of these. It also include characters
as we did in language <A HREF="homework4.html">E4</A>. E6's concretized
abstract syntax is given by the following grammar:

<p>

<PRE>
prog := '(' { fundef | globaldef } ')' exp

fundef := '(' 'fun' fname typ '(' { var typ } ')' exp ')'

globaldef := '('  'global' vname exp ')'

typ := 'Int'
| 'Bool'
| 'Char'
| '(' typ '.' typ ')'
| '[' typ ']'
| letter

exp := var
| '(' ':=' var exp ')'
| '(' 'write' exp ')'
| '(' 'local' '(' { var exp } ')' exp ')'
| '(' 'block' { exp } ')'
| '(' '@' fname { exp } ')'
| '(' 'while' exp exp ')'

| True
| False
| '(' 'if' exp exp exp ')'

| int
| '(' '+' exp exp ')'
| '(' '-' exp exp ')'
| '(' '*' exp exp ')'
| '(' '/' exp exp ')'
| '(' '<=' exp exp ')'

| char
| '(' = exp exp ')

| '(' 'pair' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'fst' exp ')'
| '(' 'snd' exp ')'

| '(' 'cons' exp exp ')'
| '(' 'head' exp ')'
| '(' 'tail' exp ')'
| 'nil'
| '(' null exp ')'


fname := letter { letter | digit }
var := letter { letter | digit }
</PRE>

<p>
Note that there is now a new type of syntax to represent types (<B>typ</B>).
Note that the expressions (<B>exp</B>) come arranged in groups organized around
the type of values they manipulate.

<ul>
<li> The first group includes the control structures.
<li> <B>Bool</B>.The second group
includes the boolean constants <B>True</B> and <B>False</B>, and the operation
on booleans <B>if</B>.
<li> <B>Int</B>. The third group includes integer constants and operations on integers.
<li> <B>Char</B>. The fourth group includes character constants and character equality.
<li> <B>( typ . typ ). </B> The fifth group includes operations on pairs.
<li> <B>[ typ ]</B>. The fourth group includes operations on lists.

</ul>

<p>

The semantics of E6 expressions and functions are similar to those of previous
homeworks. All scoping is static. The scope of each function name is the entire
program, allowing two or more functions to be mutually recursive. The language
obeys a type discipline, distinguishing integers, characters, booleans, lists, and
pairs; every variable and expression must belong to a unique type. Each function
parameter is explicitly typed, as is the function result.

<p>

For example, the code

<p>

<PRE>
(fun f Int (b Bool p (Int . Int))
           (if b (+ (fst p) (snd p)) 0))
</PRE>
<p>

defines a function f with return type Int , and two parameters: b  (whose type is
Bool), and p (whose type is a Pair of Ints).


<p>

Local variables and globals do not have to be explicitly typed, as their types can always be
infered from their initializing expressions.

<p>

It is a typing error to use an undefined function or variable name, or to define
the same function name twice. If the same variable name appears twice in a
parameter list or local declaration, the second appearance hides the first.

<p>

An E6 interpreter in Haskell (only) has been provided ( hw6.hs ). It reads a file
containing an E6 program in the syntax described above, echoes the program (to
confirm correct parsing), performs some typechecking on it, executes it
(possibly producing output from write expressions), and displays the overall
result, and then places the user in a read-typecheck-eval-print loop.

<p>

The typechecker catches some typing errors. For example, the
<A HREF="../code/hw6/badprog.e6">program</A>:
<p>

<PRE>
(
(fun not Bool (y Bool) (if y False True))
(fun f Int (x Int) (+ 2 3))
)
(@not (@ f 4))
</PRE>
<p>
casues the following output
<p>
<PRE>
********** PARSING ******************
Program:
((fun not Bool (y Bool) (if y False True))
 (fun f Int (x Int) (+ 2 3)))
(@ not (@ f 4))

********** Type Checking *************
not::(Bool-> Bool)
f::(Int-> Int)


******** LOADING DEFS **************
not f

********** EXECUTING BODY **********
*** Exception: Non Bool as argument to if test: 5
</PRE>
<p>

The error is caused because f 's result type (i.e ., Int ) doesn't match the
argument type of not (i.e., Bool ).

<p>
<H3>What to do</H3>

<ol>

<li> <B>sol6A.hs (45 points)</B> . For many programs, the output of the typechecker will be the message:
<B>Typechecking failed: unimplemented</B> indicating that the necessary
typechecking code is missing. Your task is to complete the typechecker, by doing
proper typechecking at the eight places where the unimplemented message is
currently generated (between lines 375 and 485).

<p>

Use the existing code as a model. Your completed interpreter should be able to
find all type errors in E6 programs. You may use <A HREF="../code/hw6/typedlists.e6">typedlists.e6</A>
as one test file. But I don't guarantee how much that file covers all the features
of language E6. All the changes you need to make are between lines 375 and 485 of
<A HREF="../code/hw6/Hw6.hs">Hw6.hs</A>. You need to remove
the calls to <B>notYet (sh term)</B> and replace it with your own
haskell code. There are 8 such calls. Hint. If there is an unimplemented
case for an Exp, look what happens at similar cases.

<p>

If you've done it properly, the interpreter should never fail during evaluation
with a checked runtime error of any kind.

<p>

Put your modified interpreter into a file called
sol6A.hs and submit it.
<p>

<li> <B>sol6B.txt (25 points)</B>. Run the small file <A HREF="../code/hw6/simple.e6">simple.e6</A>.
Inside the read-typecheck-eval-print loop, type in 10 expressions.
Each expression should cause a type error. You should choose your
10 expressions so they exercise the code you wrote in in <B>sol6A.hs</B>
above. Collect a transcript of the entire interaction, place it in a file
called <B>sol6B.txt</B>, and submit it to D2L.  Here is a sample
solution with only one test.
<p>

<PRE>
********** PARSING ******************
Program:
((global n 7)

</PRE>
<p>

<I>Be sure your file has 10 tests, and that it exercises code you wrote!</I>.


<li> <B>sol6C.e6 (30 points)</B>. In this part you will write a small E6 program to solve the
following problems.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Write a function that reverses a list in place. To do this you will need
to use expressions of the form <B>(:= (tail x) y)</B>. This function
depends upon the imperative features of language E6. If a variable <B>l1</B>
has value <B>[1,2,3]</B>, the call <B>(@ reverse l1)</B>, it will return
<B>[3,2,1] </B>. You may not use the primitive operations <B>cons</B>
inside the definition of reverse.
<p>

<li> Write a small function that computes
all rotations of a list of any length.  For example the call
<B>(@ rotate (@ list3 1 2 3))</B>
on a list of length 3, returns the lists
<B>[[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2]]</B>.  You may
use any of the functions from <A HREF="../code/hw6/typedlists.e6">typedlists.e6</A>
as well as the E6 language primitives.
The type of rotate is [a] -> [[a]]. Note you will need to put
types in the function definitions.
<p>
Hint: Write a helper function with two parameters, and use it to define rotate.
<p>

<li>
Write a standard quicksort algorithm in language E6. It should have type
<B>qsort:: [Int] -> [Int]</B>.
<p>
</ul>
Place all these functions in a file <B>sol6C.e6</B> and submit it to D2L.

</ol>
