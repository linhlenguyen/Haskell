======================================================================
1) for each of the functions "concat", "factors", and "allTrue",
defined below write another version of the function that does not use
a while loop, but instead uses a local function that uses an
accumulating parameter. E.g. your answer will look something like:

fun f x =
  let fun help ....
  in help ... end;

------------------------------------------------------

fun concat xs =
let val xsRef = ref xs
    val ansRef = ref []
in while (not (null (!xsRef))) do
     ( ansRef := !ansRef @  (hd (!xsRef))
     ; xsRef := tl (!xsRef)
     );
  !ansRef
end;

fun divides x y = y mod x = 0;

fun factors n =
let val count = ref (n-1)
    val ans = ref []
in while (!count > 1) do
     ( if divides (!count) n
          then ans := !count :: !ans
          else ()
     ; count := !count - 1
     );
  !ans
end;

fun allTrue xs =
let val xsRef = ref xs
    val ansRef = ref true
in while (not (null (!xsRef))) do
     ( ansRef := ((!ansRef) andalso (hd (!xsRef)))
     ; xsRef := tl (!xsRef)
     );
   !ansRef
end;

2) This problem is a guided description to defining the eclosure
function for a second time. It has a number of steps. Follow each step
carefully. Each step is used in the next step. Turn in all the functions
you write (using the names I have indicated), and run some tests.

a) First study the declarations of the data we will use. Cut
and paste these into your solution file.

datatype Label = Epsilon | Char of char;
type Start = int;
type Finish = int;
datatype Edge = Edge of Start * Label * Finish;

b) Cut and paste the following sample NFA into your solution file.
It defines 4 variables "n1" the whole NFA. "s1" the start state (8),
"f1" the final state (15), and "es1" the list of edges.

val (n1 as (s1,f1,es1)) =
  (8,15,
   [Edge (9,Epsilon,10),Edge (8,Epsilon,0),Edge (8,Epsilon,6),
    Edge (1,Epsilon,9),Edge (7,Epsilon,9),Edge (0,Char #"+",1),
    Edge (6,Epsilon,2),Edge (6,Epsilon,4),Edge (3,Epsilon,7),
    Edge (5,Epsilon,7),Edge (2,Char #"-",3),Edge (4,Epsilon,5),
    Edge (11,Epsilon,14),Edge (10,Char #"D",11),Edge (14,Epsilon,12),
    Edge (13,Epsilon,15),Edge (14,Epsilon,15),Edge (15,Epsilon,14),
    Edge (12,Char #"D",13)]);

c) Draw a picture of the NFA. This will help you visualize what's
going on. Hand in the picture with your homework.

d) Write three functions. Each will have a single clause that
pattern matches over the single constructor "Edge". Test your
functions (start (hd es1)) --->  9
          (final (hd es1)) --->  10
          (label (hd es1)) ---> Epsilon

start:: Edge -> int
final:: Edge -> int
label:: Edge -> Label

e) Once we have the three functions above, we can use the filter
function to answer a number of questions. To find what edges
have transitions on label (Char #"D") we type:

filter (fn x => label x = Char #"D") es1;


Recall that (fn x => label x = Char #"D") is an anonymous function.
We could have written    -- fun f1 x = (label x) = (Char #"D");
Then typed (filter f1 es1), to get the same effect.
Type one of these in and see for yourself. There should be two edges
with start states of 10 and 12.  Now, using the example above
as a pattern write two functions

startsOn :: int -> Edge list -> Edge list
endsOn::    int -> Edge list -> Edge list

(startsOn n) returns all the edges whose start state is n. endOn is
similar. Once you've written these functions try them out. See that you
get the same answers I do.

startsOn 14 es1;
val it = [Edge (14,Epsilon,12),Edge (14,Epsilon,15)] : Edge list

f) Now write a fancier function that returns all the edges
that start at "n" and have label "Epsilon". This will require
and "andalso" in the (fn x => ....) given as a argument to "filter";

fun epsilonEdgesFrom n edges = ...

Test your function to see you get the same answers I do.

- epsilonEdgesFrom 15 es1;
val it = [Edge (15,Epsilon,14)] : Edge list

g) The "map" function can be used to apply a function to every element
in a list. Try this out

map final [Edge(1,Epsilon,3),Edge(3,Char #"A",5)];

You should get [3,5]. Note how (final (Edge(1,Epsilon,3))) ---> 3
and (final (Edge(3,Char #"A",5))) ---> 5,  and map lets us do
all this in 1 step.  Try the following (map start es1). What
do you think you will get?  Now write a function "epsilonNodesFrom"
which has type epsilonNodesFrom:: int -> Edge list -> int list,
(epsilonNodesFrom n es) returns all the nodes reachable from a single
Epsilon edge "n" in "es".  You should write this function
using "map" and "epsilonEdgesFrom". Do you get the same answer I do?

- epsilonNodesFrom 14 es1;
val it = [12,15] : Finish list

h) The details of this step you should work out yourself. Write the
function whose type is listed below.

epsilonNodesFromMany:: int list -> Edge list -> int list

It should get all the nodes reachable from any one of A LIST OF NODES
using a single Epsilon edge. There are many ways to do this. If you
don't use epsilonNodesFrom in your solution, you've wasted all the work
we did above. Test your function to see if you get the same answers I
do.

- epsilonNodesFromMany [8] es1;
val it = [0,6] : Finish list
- epsilonNodesFromMany [1,7] es1;
val it = [9,9] : Finish list

i) Recall, that the nodes reachable by Epsilon transitions in one
step should include the nodes started from. This suggests we should
append the input to the output of "epsilonNodesFromMany".

If we do this and some node has a self-loop (Edge(2,Epsilon,2)) or two
different nodes in the input have edges to the same node we will get
duplicate states in the list of final states.

This step requires you to write a function "oneStep". For reasons that
will become clear in a moment, You must write a function that takes its
arguments in the reverse order from "epsilonNodesFromMany". "oneStep"
computes the final list (reachable using "epsilonNodesFromMany"), adds
the original list to the final list, and then normalizes this result.
Normalization removes duplicates, and sorts the result. Compare the
types of the two functions to be sure you get the arguments in the right
order.

oneStep:              Edge list  -> Start list -> Finish list
epsilonNodesFromMany: Start list -> Edge list  -> Finish list

To make your job easier, I have written a function "norm:: int list ->
int list" which removes duplicates and places the elements in the list
in ascending order. You can find this function, and the other pieces you
need on the Assignments web page. Use this function to write a version
of "epsilonNodesFromMany", which performs input addition and
normalization, called "oneStep".

j) Now compute the following progression, using the test data.

val e1 = oneStep es1 [8];
val e2 = oneStep es1 e1;
val e3 = oneStep es1 e2;
...

Continue this process until the input is identical to the output. What
does this mean?  This will always eventually terminate. Can you make an
argument why?

You should write a function that repeatably applies "oneStep" until the
output is equal to the input. You may use recursion or a while loop when
you write your function

repeatTilSame: Edge list -> int list -> int list

Congratulations, you have written the eclosure function! Turn in an
explanation why this computes the eclosure.
