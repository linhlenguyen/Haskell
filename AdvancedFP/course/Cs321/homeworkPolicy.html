<LI>
When you hand in homework, please hand in the following:

<OL>
<LI>
The complete file as you wrote it, with no extra text, etc. I should be
able to load the file (as is) into SML.

<LI>
A trace of your test of the program. This should include commands to
load the file above, and a sequence of tests that test the code you
wrote. Many times I ask you to extend some code. Be sure and test the
code you wrote, not my code. My code has enough errors I don't want to
know about new ones, unless it affects your code.

<LI>
You should include enough tests to convince me your program works. You
should include enough tests so that every statement in your program is
exercised at least once in some test.  3 tests per function is the
minimum, some functions may require more if they have many paths.

<LI>
An optional cover sheet where you provide any additional information I
need to grade your assignment.
</OL>

<LI>
Be sure that your name is clearly written on the top left hand side of
what you hand in.

<LI>
If your program doesn't load, a trace of the errors may help me figure
out what went wrong, so I can suggest a fix.

<LI>
Homework is for your benefit. If you don't do it, you won't learn the material.
Thus it is to your benefit to do homework, even if you can't turn it
in on time. I'll accept homework up to 1 week late, but I reserve the right
to subtract 10-15% of the points as a penalty.
