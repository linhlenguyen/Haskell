Lexical Analysis (Scanning)

In this assignment you will use ML-Lex, a lexical analysis tool, to
automate the process of scanning a MINI program. You will turn in a
ML-Lex specification file and a driver program (containing at a
minimum "testLexer", "printResult", a datatype declaration for "token",
and an exception declaration for "Error").

*** Overview:

ML-Lex takes a language specification as input and returns
an ML program that can be used to conduct the lexical
analysis step.  The basic functionality of the driver
program will be to open a file, containing a MINI program
(or attempt at a MINI program, in the case of an incorrect
syntax), and return a list of tokens.  The driver program
will use the ML program that was output by ML-Lex.

*** General Process Steps:

1. Download and read the MINI specification:
http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs321/project/mini-manual.pdf
A REVISED VERSION has now been posted, so please get the newest
version before you begin.

2. If have not already done so, either install SML on your own machine
or add sml package (#58) to your Unix environment (any machine
belonging to cs.pdx.edu).  Make sure that your path is correctly
configured following the directions given earlier. If it is you should
be able to invoke ML-Lex by typing "ml-lex filename.lex"

3. Read the ML-Lex manual, which can be found at:
http://www.smlnj.org/doc/ML-Lex/manual.html

4. There are three components to the ML-Lex specification: user
declarations, ML-Lex definitions, and rules.  In the specification,
these sections appear in the order listed and are separated by double
percent signs: %%.  The ML-Lex manual describes how to construct these
sections.  Make sure to include the two required user declarations.

5. Once your specification file is ready, run ML-Lex: ml-lex p1.lex.
This will produce an output file called pl.lex.ml.


6. Write a driver (in ML) that takes a file as input and returns a
list of tokens.  The driver should be in the form of 2 functions
"testLexer" with type testLexer : string -> (int*token) list,

i.e. something like  [(1,KW_boolean),(1,Integer "2"),(4,KW_int) ...]

and "printResult" with type printResult : (int*token) list -> unit
"printResult" should output the results in the following format:
linenumber token syntatic-category.  For the purpose of assignment
submission, "printResult" should write to the "stdout".  The
syntatic-category for each valid token will be the datatype "token".
The lexer must return EOF on end of file. You must also
devise a way to print values of this datatype, for use in your
function "printResult". The output should look like:

-------------------
line 1 KW_boolean
line 1 Integer 2
line 4 KW_int
...
-------------------

*** Error-Reporting Requirements:

For the MINI language, there are four possible lexical errors:

1. Illegal character: one not in MINI.s vocabulary (e.ge #)
2. Integer over limit: an integer over the limit (2^31- 1)
3. ID over limit: an ID whose length is greater than 255
4. String over limit: a string whose length is over 255
  (not counting the quotes)

You need to detect all four kinds of lexical errors.  However, it is
only necessary to detect and report only the first error in a given
program and then terminate.  The error reporting should take the form
of a raised exception and it should contain the nature of the error
(which kind) and the location (line and column number) where it
occurred. You must define your own exception.

Your driver programs should catch any exceptions raised, and die
gracefully by printing out an error message describing the exception.

*** Additional Resources:

1.  Text book Chapter 2.
2.  Some MINI programs can be found in the directory:
       www.cs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs321/project/Lex/tests
    You should use these to test your specification and driver.
    However, we will use a larger set of test files for grading,
    including programs with syntax errors.

*** What and How to Turn in Your Program:

1. submit your ML-Lex specification and driver program electronically
   to: sheard@cs.pdx.edu

   a) The subjectline should be P1Last-name, so if your last name is
      "Jones" the subject line should only contain "P1Jones"

   b) The 2 files should be attachments, and they should be named
      LexLast-name.lex  and  DriverLast-name.sml, using the same
      convention used for the subject line.

   c) We should be able to run ML-Lex on LexLast-name.lex and SML on
      DriverLast-name.sml, and then call the functions "testLexer"
      without any other intervening input from the testers.

   d) PLEASE! Only submit a solution once. So be sure you have
      everything the way you want it before you submit.
