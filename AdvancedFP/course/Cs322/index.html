<A HREF="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs321/index.html">Prerequisite.</A>
This course is a continuation of CS321. Much of the material in this quarter
depends upon knowledge taught in that course. The notes from winter
2007 for CS321 can be found <A HREF="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Cs321/index.html">here</A>..

<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%">
This course is about programming languages and compilers. We will
study programming languages, learn to propram in one new language (ML),
and write a compiler for a familiar language (Java subset).

<UL>
        <LI> An important part of the course is a large programming project.
        <LI> There will be daily small (approximately 1 page) <A HREF="assignments/index.html">assignments</A> given each
             class, which are due the next time class meets, in addition to the project.
        <LI> There will be weekly 5 minute quizes to test the reading assigments.

We will write programs in ML. The recommended compiler is Standard ML of New Jersey.
You can download a version to install on your own machine
<A HREF="http://www.smlnj.org/">here.</A>

<UL>
        <LI> I will handout extensive notes on SML. Additional books
             about ML are listed <A HREF="http://www.smlnj.org/doc/literature.html#books">here.</A>
        <LI> An excellent set of notes, by Riccardo Pucella, about programming in ML is <A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/riccardo/smlnj.html">here.</a>
        <LI> Freely available tutorials about learning to program in ML
             are listed <A HREF="http://www.smlnj.org/doc/literature.html#tutorials">here.</A>
             I recommend the one by <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~petel/smlguide/smlnj.htm">Peter Lee</A> as a good place to get started.
        <LI> If you use the Solaris (unix) machines at PSU, you can get SML by
             typing:  "addpkg sml", This installs the correct pathways and symbols.
             Then just type "sml".

Below I will post announcements. I will post new announcements in front
of old ones, so the old ones will always still be there,  only further down the page.
