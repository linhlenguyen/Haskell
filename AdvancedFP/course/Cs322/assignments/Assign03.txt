CS322 Prog Lang & Compilers                      Prog Assignment #3
Assigned Tuesday April 17, 2007.       Due Thursday, April 19, 2007

This assignment is to extend the stmt program discussed in class
(and available for download) so that it can translate while loops
and block statements.

 fun stmt dict (While(tst,body)) = . . .
   | stmt dict (Block stmts) = . . .

Base your solution on the if-then-else statement and the discussion
in the text book about while-loops. You don’t need to add any new
IR instructions. Block statemtents are very easy (think about what
they do). Be sure and test your code, print out the tests,
and hand them in.
