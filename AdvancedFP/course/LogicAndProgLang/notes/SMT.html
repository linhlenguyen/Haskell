<BIG> Satisfiability Modulo Theorys - SMT Provers </BIG>
</CENTER>
<p>
An important type class of theorem provers are called
SMT provers. A SMT prover combines satifiability (over boolean
formulas) with other theories (such as theories of linear arithmetic,
arrays, lists, etc.). These have many applications in areas such has
hardware design and software verification.

<p>
<H3>Overview</H3>
In this lecture we will do three things
<ol>

<li> Get an overview of how SMT provers work. Using the <A HREF="http://www.open-do.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/SMT_provers.pdf">notes</A>
of Johannes Kanig.

<li> Get an introduction to using a real SMT solver <A HREF=" http://yices.csl.sri.com/">Yices</A>.

<li> Apply Yices to a real problem,  test generation, in a
toy domain (a while language), that illustrates
how SMT provers are used to analyze software.
</ol>

<H3>Basic Skills</H3>

In order to use a SMT-prover, you will need to
understand how to do the following basic tasks:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Inrtroduce variables and function symbols
<li> Assert formulae
<li> Check for satisfiability
<li> Extract assingments and counter examples.
</ul>
<p>
In my experience there were two invaluable resources for learning to do this.
<ul>
 <li> The yices 2 <A HREF="http://yices.csl.sri.com/papers/manual.pdf">manual</A>.
 <li> The Yices library of <A HREF="http://yices.csl.sri.com/examples.shtml">small examples</A>.
 <li> The Yices "input language" <A HREF="http://yices.csl.sri.com/language.shtml">help pages</A>.
</ul>
<p> I suggest you study these, and the <A HREF="yices/queens.ys">example</A> we will look at in the lecture.

<H3>Installing and using Yices.</H3>
We will be using <A HREF=" http://yices.csl.sri.com/">Yices</A> as our SMT-prover.
Basic tasks and skills you will need to accompish.

<ul>
<li> Download and install Yices on your machine.
  <ol> <li> Go to the <A HREF="http://yices.csl.sri.com/index.shtml">download page</A> and follow the instructions for your type of machine.
       <li> On windows, I simply downloaded the standalone distribution (no cygwin required, with the statically linked GMP).
       I unzipped it and used a command line argument to start execution of the yices.exe in the bin directory. You may want to
       add yices to your path.
       <li> If you have problems, or wish to add notes about installing on other
            kinds of machines, let me know, and I will add directions here.
       </ol>

<li> Learn the basic modes of using Yices.
  <ol> <li> Interactive use

<H3>Generating input parameters to increase test coverage.</H3>


The Problem: (summarized from a <A HREF="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/SMT@MS.pdf">talk</A> by Leonardo de Moura and Nikolaj Bjørner.
<p>

<ul>
<li> Given program with a set of input parameters.
<li> Generate inputs that maximize code coverage.
<li> Example
<PRE>
Input x, y;
{z = x + y;
 If z > x - y Then
    <FONT COLOR="#008000">Return z</FONT>
 Else
    <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Error "bad"</FONT>
}
</PRE>
<li> What inputs must I choose to guarantee that I test a path
that executes the <FONT COLOR="#008000">Return z</FONT>? or the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Error</FONT>
<li> For <FONT COLOR="#008000">Return z</FONT> Solve:  z = x + y  /\  z > x - y
<li> solution:  <FONT COLOR="#008000">x = 1, y = 1</Font>
<li> For <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Error "bad"</FONT> Solve:  z = x + y  /\  ¬(z > x - y)
<li> solution:  <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">x = 1, y = -1</Font>
<li>
</ul>

<H3>SMT-Lib</H3>

<A HREF="http://www.smtcomp.org/2011/">SMT-COMP</A> is an annual competition
that challenges the developers of SMT solvers to improve their solvers. In
order to allow multiple solvers to solve a common set of problems, a standard
language, <A HREF="http://www.smtlib.org/">SMT-LIB</A>, has
been developed that competing solvers must support.
The input and output to SMT solvers usually conforms to this standard.
A reference for users who wish to learn how to format SMT input in the SMT-LIB
format is the
<A HREF="http://www.grammatech.com/resources/smt/SMTLIBTutorial.pdf">SMT-LIB tutorial</A>.
More information about resources available for SMT-LIB can be found
