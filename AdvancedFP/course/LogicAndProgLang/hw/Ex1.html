<BIG> Mathematical Logic and Programming Languages Exercise #1 </BIG>
</CENTER>

<p> This is the first exercise. A solution should be about 45 lines of
code. It is due in two days, that is Wednesday October 1, by class time
(2:00 PM). You must submit your solution. It will not be graded, but it I
will check that it is submitted and will glance over it. Be prepared
to discuss what you have done. We will spend considerable time discussing
this in class on Wednesday. You may be called upon to elaborate your
submission.

<p> In this exercise you will implement some simple algorithms for
propositional logic in Haskell. You will use the file <A HREF="SimpleProp.hs">SimpleProp.hs</A> that
implements the data structures for propositional logic <B>(Prop n)</B> a pretty
printer for propositional logic <B>(pp)</B>, and a valuation function <B>(value)</B> for
propositional logic.  You may want to study these functions before you
begin the exercise below.
<p>
Write the following functions

<ul>

<li> <B>addvars :: Ord a => Prop a -> [a] -> [a]</B> <br>
The function <B>addvars</B> adds the propositional variables  of its first argument
to the list which is its second argument. For example the
call <B>addvars ((LetterP 1) \/ (LetterP 3) ~> (LetterP 1)) [2]</B>  returns
the list <B>[1,2,3]</B>.  Note that every variable appears only once in the result.
<p>

<li> Using <B>addvars</B> write the function <B>vars :: Ord a => Prop a -> [a]</B>.
<p>

<li> Write the function <B>assigns</B>, that given a <B>[Int]</B> (representing a list of propositional variables) compute a
<B>[[(Int,Bool)]]</B>, representing all possible Boolean valuations for those
variables. For example <B>assigns [2,5]</B> returns the list
<B>[[(2,True),(5,True)],[(2,True),(5,False)],[(2,False),(5,True)],[(2,False),(5,False)]]</B>
Note that the length of the output list will always be 2 raised to the power of
the length of the input lists.
<p>
<li> Write the predicate over propositional formula <B>taut:: Prop Int -> Bool</B> that
checks if a formula is a tautology.
<p>

<li> Write the binary predicate over propositional formula <B>equal:: Prop Int -> Prop Int -> Bool</B> that
checks if two formula are functionally equivalent.
<p>


</ul>

<p> Put all these functions into a file called <A HREF="Ex1.hs">Ex1.hs</A>, test your functions and submit it to D2L.
