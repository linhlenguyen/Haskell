<BIG> Mathematical Logic and Programming Languages Exercise #3 </BIG>
</CENTER>

<p> This is the third exercise. It is due before class on Monday October 13, 2014
(1:45 PM). You must submit your solution to D2L. It will not be graded, but it I will check
that it is submitted and I will glance over it. Be prepared to discuss what you have
done. We will spend considerable time discussing this in class on Monday. You may be
called upon to elaborate your submission.

<p> In this exercise you will implement an algorithm for proving propositions by
the tableau method.
<p>
The goal is to write a series of functions that implement a tableau prover. I suggest you read
the pages 15-24 in the Smullyan text. The first part of this covered in class on Wed Oct 8.
THye big step is recognizing that we don't have to used the "signed formulas" (tagging every formula
with True or False.
<p>
The first thing is to recognize that the unsigned tableau prover proceeds very much the way that
the Discrimator CNF function. Read page 20 carefully and verify that the discrim function
below cooresponds to the figure on page 20.

<p>

<PRE>
data Discrim a = Alpha a a | Beta a a | Lit a

discrim :: Prop a -> Discrim (Prop a)
discrim TruthP = Lit TruthP
discrim AbsurdP = Lit AbsurdP
discrim (LetterP s) = Lit (LetterP s)
discrim (AndP x y) = Alpha x y
discrim (OrP x y) = Beta x y
discrim (ImpliesP x y) = Beta (NotP x) y
discrim (NotP (OrP x y)) = Alpha (NotP x)  (NotP y)
discrim (NotP (ImpliesP x y)) = Alpha x (NotP y)
discrim (NotP (AndP x y)) = Beta (NotP x) (NotP y)
discrim (NotP (NotP x)) = discrim x
discrim (NotP TruthP) = Lit AbsurdP
discrim (NotP AbsurdP) = Lit TruthP
discrim (NotP (LetterP s)) = Lit (NotP (LetterP s))

processCl :: [Prop a] -> [[Prop a]]
processCl [] = [[]]
processCl (p : ps) =
  case (discrim p) of
    Lit x -> map (x:) (processCl ps)
    Alpha x y -> processCl (x : ps) ++ processCl (y : ps)
    Beta x y -> processCl (x : y : ps)
</PRE>

<p>
It is also good to note that the Tableau diagrams of the text also correspond
to the lists of the input and output of prcessCl. How?
<p>

<PRE>
         F- p0 \/ (p1 /\ p2) => ((p0 \/ p1) /\ (p0 \/ p2))
                        T- p0 \/ (p1 /\ p2)
                    F- (p0 \/ p1) /\ (p0 \/ p2)
+------------------------------+    +------------------------------+
|            T- p0             |    |         T- p1 /\ p2          |
|+-----------+    +-----------+|    |            T- p1             |
||F- p0 \/ p1|    |F- p0 \/ p2||    |            T- p2             |
||F- p0      |    |F- p0      ||    |+-----------+    +-----------+|
||F- p1      |    |F- p2      ||    ||F- p0 \/ p1|    |F- p0 \/ p2||
|+-----------+    +-----------+|    ||F- p0      |    |F- p0      ||
+------------------------------+    ||F- p1      |    |F- p2      ||
                                    |+-----------+    +-----------+|
                                    +------------------------------+


</PRE>

The final thing to note is that in order to close off a Branch we need to keep a list of
propositions we have on the current path. How might implement this.
