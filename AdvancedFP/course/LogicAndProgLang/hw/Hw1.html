<BIG> Mathematical Logic and Programming Languages Homework #1 </BIG>
</CENTER>

<p> This is the first Homework. It will be graded and a grade will be assigned.
This homework should not take more than a couple of hours.

<p> In this homework you will construct a few Natural deduction style proofs
using the code discussed in lecture. You will need the following 3 files.
<ol> <li> <A HREF="NaturalDeduction/NatDed.hs">NatDed.hs</A>
     <li> <A HREF="NaturalDeduction/Blocks.hs">Blocks.hs</A>
     <li> <A HREF="NaturalDeduction/SimpleProp.hs">SimpleProp.hs</A>
</ol>
You may want to study these files before you begin the homework. Your goal is
to construct 5 terms of type NatDed, and run the checker to see that your
terms are valid proofs of the following statements.

<ul>
<li> p /\ q |- q /\ p
<p>

<li>(p /\ q /\ r), (s /\ t) |- q /\ s
<p>


<li> p -> (q -> r), p -> q |- p -> r
<p>


<li> p1 -> p2,  ~p2 |- ~p1
<p>
This rule schema is called modus Tollens
<p>

<li> p1 \/ ~p1 <p>
This is often called the rule if the excluded middle<p>
</ul>

<p>


</ul>

<p> Put all these functions into a file called <A HREF="Hw1.hs">Hw1.hs</A>,
check your proofs and submit it to D2L.
