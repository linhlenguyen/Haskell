My office is in the Computer Science Building, in the Fourth Ave
Building, FAB 120-04.
The FAB is on the corner of Fourth Ave and Harrison, 200 feet from
the Trolley-line stop on Harrison. FAB is connected to the City
Offices Tower. There are two entrances to FAB. One that enters the
FAB building directly on Harrison, and the second one that enters
the City Offices Tower on Fourth Ave, and then leads (through that
building) into the FAB building.

<p>
If you enter on Harrison, walk straight ahead down the corridor. Take the elevators up
to the 1st floor. Immediately to the right as you exit the elevators
is the Computer Science Department.

<P>

If you enter the City Office Tower from Fourth Ave.,
walk to the left (past a set of elevators) down a long hallway that
connects the City Office Tower to the Fourth Ave Building. At the
end of the hallway you come to the elevator foyer and the Computer
Science Department is on your right.

<P>

From the elevator lobby, Walk through 2 sets of glass doors into
Suite 120. My office is 120-04 (on the left) just past the reception
desk. The receptionist will be happy to show you to my office.
