<BIG>Merge and Quik sort</BIG>
</CENTER>

<p>
In this homework you will write two sorts over
lists that sort in time proportional to n * log(n) where
n is the length of the input in the average case.
<p>
What to do
<p>
<ul>
<li> Cut and pase the program template between the
solid horizontal rules, and create a file called
HW04.hs
<li> Study the functions and comments and assertions in the
program template.
<li> For each undefined, replace it with some Haskell
code that makes the assertions run True. You can test
this by using runTestTT on the tests t1, t2, t3, etc.
<li> Work from the top of the file to the bottom. Each function
is designed to illustrate one concept. A comment tells what the function
is supposed to do in words, and the assertions give examples
that your solutions should adhere to.
<li> Create a main function that illustrates that your code works.
<li> Be sure that the toplevel command "tests" has no
errors and no failures
</ul>

<H3>What to turn in.</H3>
Create a file by cutting and pasting the template between
the dark black horizontal lines.  Be sure you do the following
<ul>
<li> Note how the template follows the design recipes. You should
model future programs after the template.
<li> Include your name (as the author of the program) on the very first line
<li> Replace the all "undefined" with haskell code.
<li> Create a main function that illustrates your code works
<li> Be sure the "tests" command runs with no erros and no failures.
<li> Uploaded the file to blackboard
<li> Due before class on Tuesday, October 27, 2009.
</ul>
