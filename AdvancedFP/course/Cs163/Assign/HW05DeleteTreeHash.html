<BIG>Deleting from Binary Search Tree and Sequentional Hash</BIG>
</CENTER>

<p>
In this homework you will write two functions.
The first implements a deleting function over a binary search tree,
and the second implements Hashing function stored in a array
with sequential search to diambiguate collissions.
<p>
What to do
<p>
<ul>
<li> Cut and pase the program template between the
solid horizontal rules, and create a file called
HW05.hs
<li> Study the functions and comments and assertions in the
program template.
<li> For each undefined, replace it with some Haskell
code that makes sense.
<li> Work from the top of the file to the bottom. Each function
is designed to illustrate one concept. A comment tells what the function
is supposed to do in words, and the assertions give examples
that your solutions should adhere to.
<li> Extend the functions testD and testH so that they exercise
your code thoroughly.
<li> Create a main function that illustrates that your code works.
</ul>
<p>
Instructions
<p>
Start with deleteTree.
<ul>
<li> There are 4 interesting cases.
(1) The the tree is empty.
(2) The tree is a branch with empty left sub-tree.
(3) The tree is a branch with empty right sub-tree
(4) The tree is a branch
with two non-empty subtrees. Fill in the undefined
to reflect this structure.
<li> Case (1) is simple fill it in
<li> Case (2) and (3) have two sub-cases. Fill them in.
<li> Case (4) also has 3 sub cases, depending upon the key.
<li> Two of these are easy recursive calls.
<li> The equality case is hard.
<li> Use the function deleteMin to find the smallest
element of the right sub-tree. Use this to complete the function.
</ul>

<p>
deleteMin works by following the longest left chain without an empty.
<ul>
<li> There are 3 interesting cases.
(1) The the tree is empty. (2) The tree is a branch with empty left sub-tree.
(3) The tree is a branch with Branching left subtree
Fill in the undefined
to reflect this structure.
<li> Now work out the rest for yourself.
</ul>
<p>
Linear hashing works as follows.
<ul>
<li> Hash the key to find a slot in the array.
<li> If the slot is filled with Nothing, the key is not in the table.
<li> If the slot has (Maybe(k,v)) then test if key==v, if so the
value is v.
<li> If the key /= v, then repeatedly look in the next slot until a Nothing id found.
<li> Things to worry about.
	<ol> <li> What if the current slot is the last slot?
	     <li> What if the array is filled, and no key is found?
	     How can you tell if this happens? What answer would you return?
	     </ol>
</ul>

<H3>What to turn in.</H3>
Create a file by cutting and pasting the template between
the dark black horizontal lines.  Be sure you do the following
<ul>
<li> Include your name (as the author of the program) on the very first line
<li> Replace the all "undefined" with haskell code.
<li> Extend the testD and the testH functions to illustrate your code works
<li> Uploaded the file to blackboard
<li> Due before class on Thursday, November 5, 2009.
</ul>
