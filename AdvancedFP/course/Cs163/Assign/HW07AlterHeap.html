<BIG>Altering heaps to do new things</BIG>
</CENTER>

<p>
In this homework you will alter several programs we have
written in class to perform new things.
<ul>
<li> Alter the functions indexOfMaxChild, deleteMax, reHeapDown
insertHeap, and reHeapUp from the file <A HREF="../Code/Heaps.hs">Heaps.hs</A>
so that they implement Min-heaps instead of Max-heaps.
<li> Alter the functions heapSort2, toHeap2, fromHeap2,
from the file <A HREF="../Code/HeapSort.hs">HeapSort.hs</A> so that they
use the altered functions from part (1) above. This will allow you
to write a function that sorts an array in decreasing order
rather than increasing order.
<li> Alter the functions from the file <A HREF="../Code/Heaps.hs">Heaps.hs</A> that
implement heaps using leftist trees so that they
manipulate data composed of keys and satellite data. The functions
will now have different contracts which I list below.
<pre>
<ul>
<li> empty:: (LHeap a)
<li> isEmpty:: LHeap a -> Bool
<li> insert:: Ord key => (key,sat) -> LHeap (key,sat) -> LHeap (key,sat)
<li> merge:: Ord key => LHeap (key,sat) -> LHeap (key,sat) -> LHeap (key,sat)
<li> findMin:: Ord key => LHeap (key,sat) -> Maybe (key,sat)
<li> deleteMin:: Ord key => LHeap (key,sat) -> Maybe(LHeap (key,sat))
</ul>

</pre>
The point is that heap properties should apply only to the key part of the data.

</ul>


<p>
What to do
<p>
<ul>
<li> Cut and paste the program pieces from the files <A HREF="../Code/Heaps.hs">Heaps.hs</A>
and <A HREF="../Code/HeapSort.hs">HeapSort.hs</A>.
<li> Alter the functions that you have cut and pasted so that they
implement the features described above.
<li> Be sure and rename functions so that names of the altered functions describe
what the functions do. I will assign points according to how well
you name your functions.
<li> I suggest you work in stages, cutting and pasting only a few pieces of a time.
<li> Be sure and create test harnesses that test your code. Test it as
you proceed, so that you know each piece works, before you
alter new pieces that depend upon previously altered pieces,
<li> Create a main function that illustrates that your code works.
</ul>

<H3>What to turn in.</H3>
<ul>
<li>Create a file by cutting and pasting from the files <A HREF="../Code/Heaps.hs">Heaps.hs</A>
and <A HREF="../Code/HeapSort.hs">HeapSort.hs</A>.
<li> Include your name (as the author of the program) on the very first line
<li> Alter the cut and pasted functions to perform the features outlined above.
<li> Be sure you include tests
<li> Uploaded the file to blackboard
<li> Due before class on Tuesday , December 1, 2009.
</ul>
