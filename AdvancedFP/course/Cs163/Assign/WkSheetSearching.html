<p>
In this worksheet you will analyze the various
kinds of searching algorithms and determine what their
properties are.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Pure or imperative

<li> The cost in terms of time. This is the one-egg-metric idea. We usually
express this as a proportionality to the number of elements being searched.
For example a search might be proportional to n where n is the number of
elements being searched.

<li> The cost in terms of space to store intermediate data.

<li> What the amortized cost per element is. This means if
the data needs pre-processing (i.e. sorting), what's the cost
per element to do the sorting, and what's the cost per element to
do the searching. We need to add these together.

Part 2.

Consider the following problem, than choose a mechanism
to implement it. Discuss in about 100 words why your
choice is a good one.

A compiler creates a symbol table for every name in a
program. Entries in the table are created when the name is
first encountered. Information in the table includes things
like source location (file name, line and column), type
information, size information etc. As the compiler
translates the program this information is looked up.
Looking up information, and inserting new entries in the
table are interleaved. In about 100 words explain what
techniques you would use, and explain why it would be a
good one.

Get a copy of this worksheet (by right-clicking and the downloading)
and fill in the missing properties for each of the searches and writing the short 100 word essay.
<ul>
<li> Your name (as the author of the program) on the very first line
<li> Each of the properties filled in the appropriate blank.
<li> The whole think uploaded to blackboard
<li> Due before class on Thursday, October 29, 2009.
<li> You may cut and paste out the part of this document
not related to your answers (such as the list of properties
and the instructions of what to turn in).
