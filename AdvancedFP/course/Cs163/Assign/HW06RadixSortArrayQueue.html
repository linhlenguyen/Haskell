<BIG>Array Based Queues and Radix Sorting</BIG>
</CENTER>

<p>
In this homework you will write write a set of functions
to implement Queues using arrays, and you will will use
the Queues to implement Radix sort.
<p>
What to do
<p>
<ul>
<li> Cut and pase the program template between the
solid horizontal rules, and create a file called
HW06.hs
<li> Study the functions and comments and assertions in the
program template.
<li> For each undefined, replace it with some Haskell
code that makes sense.
<li> Work from the top of the file to the bottom. Each function
is designed to illustrate one concept. A comment tells what the function
is supposed to do in words, and the assertions give examples
that your solutions should adhere to.
<li> Extend the functions testQ and testRadix so that they exercise
your code thoroughly.
<li> Create a main function that illustrates that your code works.
</ul>
<p>

To give you some idea of how array based queues work study
the data declaration. A Queue as six components.
<p>
<pre>
data ArrQueue a =
   ArrQueue Int       -- index just to the left of the front element (if one exists)
            Int       -- index of the last element (if one exists)
            Int       -- low bound of the array
            Int       -- high bound of the array
            Bool      -- is the Queue full
            (Array a) -- the array that stores the elements
</pre>
<p>
A Queue represetned as follows:
<p>
<pre>
ArrQueue 1 3 0 3 False (listArray [undefined,undefined,5,6])
</pre>
<p>
Might be visualized as:
<p>
<pre>
   front = 1
   |
[_,_,5,6] not full
       |
       rear = 3
</pre>
To see how a sequence of operations modify the queue
study the illustration below that starts with an empty Queue
and then enQueuies and deQueues a number of elements. The pictures
illustrate the state of the Queue, and what elements are actually in the queue.
<p>
<pre>
------- enQueue 4 -------
 front = 0
 |
[_,4,_,_] not full
   |
   rear = 1

elements = [4]

------- deQueue -------
   front = 1
   |
[_,_,_,_] not full
   |
   rear = 1

elements = []

------- enQueue 5 -------
   front = 1
   |
[_,_,5,_] not full
     |
     rear = 2

elements = [5]

------- enQueue 6 -------
   front = 1
   |
[_,_,5,6] not full
       |
       rear = 3

elements = [5,6]

------- enQueue 7 -------
   front = 1
   |
[7,_,5,6] not full
 |
 rear = 0

elements = [5,6,7]

------- enQueue 8 -------
   front = 1
   |
[7,8,5,6] full
   |
   rear = 1

elements = [5,6,7,8]
</pre>
It is your job to fill in the template below to implement queues
and radix sort. Be sure your tests of the queue demonstrate
that you handle full and empty queues correctly.

<H3>What to turn in.</H3>
Create a file by cutting and pasting the template between
the dark black horizontal lines.  Be sure you do the following
<ul>
<li> Include your name (as the author of the program) on the very first line
<li> Replace the all "undefined" with haskell code.
<li> Extend the testQ and the testRadix functions to illustrate your code works
<li> Uploaded the file to blackboard
<li> Due before class on Thursday, November 12, 2009.
</ul>
