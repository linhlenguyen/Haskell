<p>
Sorts have many attributes. You should learn to study
a sort and determine if it has the following properties.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Pure or imperative
<li> The cost in terms of time. This is the one-egg-metric idea.
We usually express this as a proportionality to the number of elements being sorted or other key property.
For example a sort might be proportional to n^2 where n is the number
of elements.
<li> The cost in terms of space to store intermediate data.
<li> Whether the sort is stable.
<li> Any special requirements on the input data.
</ul>
