<p>
Earlier we studied balanced binary search trees, such as <A HREF="AvlTrees.html">AVL</A> trees, that relied
on <A HREF="Balancing Rotations.html">rotation</A> for balancing trees that were only one-level
away from balance. An alternative method for balancing
is to use multi-way branching trees like B-Trees or <A HREF="../Code/2-3Tree.hs">2-3 Trees</A>.
<p>
Key properties to multiway balanced trees are:
<p>
<ul>

<li> Branching nodes in the same tree can have different
branching factors. In a binary search tree every brancing
node has a brancing factor of 2.

<li> For a node with branching factor of n, there are (n-1)
key values, and the values in nodes in sub trees obey
invariants about which relate to the key values.

<li> There is an upper bound to the branching factor. When the upper
bound is reached, the node is split into 2-nodes each with roughly
one half the branching factor.

<li> Trees are balanced by adjusting the branching factor or some of the nodes
in a tree that is only slightly out of balance.
</ul>
<p>
A multi-way balance tree of order n has a maximum branching
factor of n.
<p>
Two common kinds of multiway balanced trees are:
<ul>
<li> B-Trees.
    <ol> <li> Often used in databases, where each node maps to a distinct disk page.
         <li> Since Disk accesses take several orders of magnitude more time to access
              than memory accesses, much time can be saved by making the nodes
              have a high order, thus making the height of the tree very small.
         <li> The shallower the tree, the fewer disk accesses necessary
         and the faster the search.
         <li> Disk drives often read a large amount of data at
              a time so this correlates with a large Node size as well.
         </ol>
<li> 2-3 Trees are multi-way trees with order 3.
	<ol> <li> Since the order is small and fixed, the code to
	     implement them is often simpler.
         <li> Intra-node search is quick since the node size is small.
         <li> Often used for main memory data rather than
              data stored on disks.
         </ol>
</ul>
