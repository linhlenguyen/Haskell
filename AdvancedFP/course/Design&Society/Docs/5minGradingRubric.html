Some comments. (A check means I noticed this in your presentation)

<LI>  When using words, restrict text to 4-8 lines per page.   
<LI>  Use color and font changes to carry a message (e.g. related concepts or experimental results in the same colors), not arbitrarily.
<LI>  Use LARGE fonts. 
<LI>  Use graphics rather than words where possible.
<LI>  Put keywords on slides to help presenter to remember what to say.
