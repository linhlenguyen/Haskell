<BIG>Short Paper #1</BIG>
</CENTER>

<p>
This assignment is to write a short paper (aproximately 4 pages)
which applies your knowledge learned from studying chapters 5 
("And Yet") and 6 ("Skeptics May Object") of the book
<A HREF="TheySayISay.jpg">They Say, I Say</A>.
<p>
The theme of the paper is <B>"The Ethics of Big Dams"</B>. You may
use as sources the <A HREF="../Readings/Narmada/index.html">reading materials</A> for the Narmada case study,
as well as any other material you can find and document in your bibliography.
<p>
If you want, you may use material about
local dams here in the Northwest, as part of your paper.
<p>
Your paper should a have an introductory paragraph that clearly states your
thesis within this theme. The rest of the paper should elaborate your thesis
statement, it should include citations, quotes, and paragraphs that support
your thesis. It must include a bibliography. It should be written in MLA style.

<p>
<H2>Using chapters 5 and 6 as a guideline.</H2>
<p> 
The theme of <B>chapter 5</B>, is to distinguish what you say, from what
the authors of your sources say. To this end I will be looking
for the following in your paper.
<ul>
<LI> Clear indication of who your sources are.
<LI> A precise description of their main ideas.
<LI> A clear description of your own ideas on the subject. 
<LI> It should be clear to the reader when you are describing the ideas 
     of others, and when you are describing your own thoughts. Use 
     "voice cues" (as described in the book) to indicate when the narrative
     makes these changes.
<LI> A clear description of how your ideas relate to the ideas of your sources.
  <ol>
  <li> How are they different?
  <li> How are they similar?
  <li> Why do your ideas differ? What evidence caused you to have differing ideas?
  </ol>
</ul>


<p>
The theme of <B>chapter 6</B>, is planting a naysayer in your text. This is recognizing
that all readers will not agree with what you have to say, and that a good
writer anticipates the objections of the readers, and then answers them.
To this end I will be looking
for the following in your paper.
<ul>
<li> You point out some of your ideas, as ideas that some readers
might likely object to.
<li> You clearly identify who you think might object.
<li> You describe why you think they might object.
<li> You describe why, in your opinion, these objections are not valid.
<li> You use some of the templates listed in chapter 6 to frame your
arguments.
</ul>

<p>

The paper is to be written in at least two passes. A first draft is due
Wednesday, April 23. This first draft should be at least 3 pages long (The
ultimate goal is a 4 page final paper).  I will grade the first draft by
comparing how well you address the ideas from the chapters 5 and 6 of 
<A HREF="TheySayISay.jpg">They Say, I Say</A>. I will use the bullet points listed above as a guideline.

<p>
I will provide feedback
(via some dictated comments) by Friday or Saturday April 25 or 26.
A final improved version of the paper is due in class Wednesday April 30.
I will grade the final draft on how much the paper improved from
the first draft. I expect significant work on the papers after the
feedback is supplied.
