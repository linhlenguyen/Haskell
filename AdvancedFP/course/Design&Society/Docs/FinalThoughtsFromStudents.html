When I entered the course in the fall term, I thought
that the class was just about reading and writing. I
thought it would (be) difficult for me to succeed in
this class since English is not my first language.
Later on, I found the class interesting because we did
not only learn about reading and writing, but we
learned about how to create, discover, and analyze
things that are used in our daily life.
<p>
Reading and understanding were difficult
task to do, especially when we I was asked to read
some novels which have many vocabulary words that
even native speakers have difficulties in knowing
what they mean.  On the other hand, writing essays
and research papers were even worse; because I had to
follow a certain format in writing the research as well
as the (requirement that) grammar should be almost perfect. I believe
that cultural difference is the major issue behind
these difficulties that I am facing right now as well
as learning English as a second language. Because
writing techniques can be similar between some
cultures, but most times there are huge differences
which make it so hard for non-native speakers to
write and follow these formats. Therefore, learning
these writing techniques and reading skills were
essential. And step by step I found that I have
improved my skills throughout the course period.

Freshmen years are often the hardest, and in many
ways that makes sense. It is a lot to ask of someone
to move out of their house, to go to a school that is
much more serious and difficult than anything that
they have encountered before and to also learn how to
cope with life on their own. I have had many of these
issues myself, time management, focus, taking
appropriate care of myself, all of these things are
very difficult tasks to learn. I feel that I have
done okay, and in some ways I am glad that things did
not go perfectly smoothly for me, as otherwise issues
that cropped up now would crop up later when there is
much less margin of error.

The mock trial turned out to be a success.  I
was very happy with the outcome of our trial.  I
think having opportunities to speak in class,
are a great tool for learning.  Just having open
discussions are fine, yet it is sometimes hard
to voice an opinion if I were unsure of the
topic.  Having time to prepare and organize my
facts allowed me not to be fearful of speaking
in public.  From the experience of the mock
trials, I allowed myself to speak up more and
not be so unsure of what I had to say.
<p>
In other classes I have a more difficult time
sharing my opinions because people tend to be
very judgmental of what other people say.  The
class I was fortunate enough to be in did
wonders for me.  When I had a question about an
assignment or a question during a lecture I was
never afraid to voice my thoughts or concerns
because no one would judge me If I had a
question.
<p>
Overall I found this class very informative on
issues I otherwise knew nothing about.  I came
into the class unsure of what to expect or what
material would be covered, yet walked away with
a knowledge I might have missed out had I not
signed up for the class.

(Getting to know) the background of each of my
classmates made me know more about each person and
how they were somewhat similar to my friends back
home; it was like I never left California.

A man stood in front of the class and introduced
himself as Tim Sheard. After two hours of ice
breakers, learning about ODIN accounts, and class
pictures, my first college assignment was assigned.
Day one and we already had homework. Seriously, who
assigns a paper on the first day?

I learned that to understand literature you have not
only know the information but connect with it. I was
taught how to relate to work, and have thoughts about
the information presented to me. Instead of reading
to be informed, I began to read to have my own
insights and opinions about the writing, this also
helped me think about how I share things with the
literature.

The debate pushed me to think quickly on my feet, and
encouraged me to communicate more fluently with my
teammates. As I was sharing information and thoughts
with my teammates, they brought up many points that I
never (even) thought about.

This class was very frustrating for me as a student
that has been in the work force for several years and
is unaccustomed to authority type figures attempting
to control every aspect of my learning process. I
have developed a learning style that enables me to
assimilate information effectively with a high recall
rate. That noted, I have examined my experience over
the last three terms and discovered, much to my
surprise, that I did get something out of this
experience besides frustration and unmarketable
skills.
<p>

This class demanded communication in pretty much
every way that you can communicate.

When I was in second grade, the principal of my
school used to always tell me how proud of me he was.
I always read to the other students, and was a great
student and athlete. Several years have passed since
then, and I know a lot more about myself as a learner
than I did before. Leaving high school as an A
student, entering college has been quite an
adventure. I have been caught plagiarizing,
vandalizing, missed classes, missed tests and
assignments, stayed out with friends on school
nights, and sleep through finals. One of the most
important goals I have learned throughout my college
career so far is to be diligent.
<p>

All and all, Design and Society has changed my life
for the better. I have learned many things (such as
not procrastinating or taking 19 credit hours EVER),
and made me a better learning. I never knew I would
say something as funny as this, but I learned to be a
good learner. From writing for so many different
kinds of audiences, I now have the ability to write
outside myself, which I did not do so well before. In
addition, my understanding of the topic of which I am
writing has improved, so such a large and vicious
looking subject no longer frightens me. And best of
all, now I have a webpage. Design and Society taught
me to exceed.

This was the first project in my entire life that I
had the opportunity to take the main role as the
leader. I never realized how many problems a group
can have, people being irresponsible, people coming
late, people not wanting to do the assignments, and
even organizing the timing to do the work as a group.
In my group we had all of these problems, but at the
end we were (still) able to accomplish our goal and finished
the bridge.
<p>

The people in class were very respectful. People
would speak and nobody would judge them or
make fun of what they were saying. In this class
everybody could say whatever they wanted to say, and
it was respected by the teacher and by the
rest of the students. I have had many classes where
students don't talk becuase they now that everyone is
going to judge them.

<p>

To be honest I came into this class thinking that I
was going to hated it. It was the class that was
picked for me. I realize now, at the end of the year,
that out of all my classes this is the class that I
have most enjoyed and learned the most. I loved every
aspect of this class and I believe that it has been a
great experience and well rounded educational
experience.
