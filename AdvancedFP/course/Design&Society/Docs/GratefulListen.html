<p> This activity sugessted by some notes created by Carol Gabrielli, cg@pdx.edu.

<B>Grateful Listening suggests that a person can create an interior 
posture that facilitates a quality of listening that is removed from 
critique or question. </B>
<p>
What do we mean by "critique or question"
<p>
Why do we listen?
<UL>
<LI> Retain information
<LI> Distill inforamtion
<LI> Repeat what we hear
</UL>
<p>

These memory skills, making-sense-of skills, and duplication skills are rooted
in inquisitive soil. At their best, all good learning activities encourage students to
examine and wonder and doubt and believe and wonder again.

<p>
Lets Brainstorm. 

<UL>
<LI> What does it mean to listen?
<LI> When was the last time you listened to some one?
<LI> When was the last time someone listened to you?
<LI> How do we know if listening is occurring?

Suppose I ask Lindsey what she did over the weekend. 
<p>

When I ask, she tells me that on Saturday she and friends had a great Italian
dinner at Nana Nina’s on Market Street. She goes on and on about the excellent
service, the good wine list, the unparalleled eggplant parmesan and, finally,
the creamy vanilla cannolis she and her friends enjoyed.

<p>
What prompted this story of Lindsey’s?
<p>
"What if the entire time Lindsey is telling me about her
dinner with friends I am thinking this: I can’t believe she went to Nana Nina’s
and thinks she had a good Italian meal or attentive service or nice wine. She
can’t possibly know what real eggplant parmesan tastes like because if she did
she would know theirs is made with processed cheeses, as are those "creamy"
cannolis she raved about. If she wants good authentic Italian food, she should
go to The Tuscany Room on Main. They have beautifully flavored and presented
foods there, and they were just written up in The Metro Restaurant Guide. I
should tell her that. As soon as she pauses to take a breath I’ll tell her so
she knows for next time. I have an extra copy of The Metro Restaurant Guide. I
will bring it in for her tomorrow. I will tell her that too.

<p>
<OL>
<LI>Am I really listening to Lindsey? 
<LI> Or is my purpose to deflate her
experience, question her judgment, belittle her abilities and educate her with
my wisdom?
</OL>

Can you think of lived experiences from both sides? as the story
teller and the story requester.
