<BIG>3 part, Spring Term Paper</BIG>
</CENTER>

<p>
The spring term paper has three parts. Each with a separate due date.
<p>
<OL>
<LI> <A HREF="#5min">5 minute presentation</A>, Due Monday May 12. Powerpoint to Tim, 11:00 am, <B>NO EXCEPTIONS</B>
<LI> <A HREF="#draft1">First Draft</A>, Due Wednesday, May 21.
<LI> <A HREF="#finalDraft">Final Paper</A>, Due Wednesday, May 28.
</OL>        
<p>

The theme of the term paper is "Equal Opportunity in the Workplace". You need
to choose your paper topic by Monday, May 12, as the first part of the
assignment is due then. You will use stakeholder methods as one of the
techniques for analyzing the case, however you should not limit yourself to
that method. Your paper should address the theory as well as tjhe facts of case
itself. Your paper should also contain your analysis of the ethics behind your
case.  The goals of
the term paper is for each student to demonstrate their mastery of the following skills.
<UL>
<LI> Use of the template and strategies for writing learned in the book <A HREF="TheySayISay.jpg">They Say, I Say</A>.
<LI> Use of the theory and skill learned from the Weiss book (Stakeholder analysis, ethical principles).
<LI> Use and analysis of census data.
<LI> UNST goal: Ethics and Social Responsibility
<LI> UNST goal: The Diversity of Human Experience
<LI> UNST goal: Communication skills (oral and writing)
</UL>

I order for you to get some ideas of what such a paper might look like,
on Wednesday, May 7, we will look at 4 <A HREF="EEOC/index.html">examples</A> of first drafts of such papers.

</OL>


<p><A name="5min">
<H1>Five Minute Presentation</H1>
<p> You will prepare and deliver a 5 minute presentation on Monday, May 12.
<p> The 5 minute presentation is designed to give each student
the opportunity to prepare and deliver a short oral presentation.
The purpose of the presentaion is two fold: (1)
to give each student the opportunity to practice the speaking skills,
(2) to help motivate the each student to identifiy and organize
the topics around which they will write their term paper.

<UL>
<LI> Identify a topic for your paper.
<LI> Either
<UL>
<LI> Find a court case that adresses equality in the work place for your topic, or a related topic
from the <A HREF="../Readings/eeoc/index.html">reading list</A> or elsewhere. Or,
<LI> Find some <A HREF="http://www.census.gov/eeo2000/">census data</A> that describes some glaring inequality in the work place.
<LI> An "A" paper, will do both.
</UL>
<LI> Do a stakeholder analysis for your topic.
<LI> Prepare a 5 minute oral presentation of 4-5 powerpoint slides.
<LI> <B>Powerpoint must be in my mailbox by 11:00 am</B>, Monday, May 12, <B>or you will get a zero</B> for the assignment.
</UL>

<p>
Grading Rubric. When grading the presentation I will look for the
following information in your presentation.
<UL>
<LI> Facts of your case
<LI> Stakeholder Analysis
<LI> Census data plotted graphically
<LI> Ethical reasoning principles
</UL>
<p>

I will also look for the following attributes of the presentation.
<UL>
<LI> It fits withing the given time (<B>5 minutes</B>).
<LI> Use graphs, pictures, visuals
<LI> Give evidence (support your claims)
<LI> Go beyond the material in the reading lists
<LI> Tells a story
</UL>

Some guidlines for Presentation preparation.

<UL>
<LI> A presentation is a tool that helps you explain to others what you have done. 
Most of the information is in your comments. The poster gives you something to refer to, and reminds you of important points.
<LI>Keep visuals simple and uncluttered
<LI> When using words, restrict text to 4-8 lines per page.   
<LI>Use color and font changes to carry a message (e.g. related concepts or experimental results in the same colors), not arbitrarily.
<LI>Use LARGE fonts. 
<LI>Use graphics rather than words where possible.
<LI>Put keywords on slides to help you remember what to say.
</UL>

<p><A name="draft1">
<H1>First Draft</H1>

You are to hand in a first draft in class on Wednesday, May 21.
Although it is not required for you to hand in the following, you might want
to create the intermediate documents.
<UL>
<LI> Annotated Bibliography, with citations, synopsis, and apt quotes.
<LI> Thesis paragraph.
<LI> Paper outline.
</UL>

<p>
<B>Writing Center:</B>  I strongly recommend making at least one appointment with the
writing center NOW.  It is best to meet with them when you have a clearly
defined topic and at least some preliminary writing.  If you wait until the end
of spring term you will not get an appointment.  It would be appropriate to
have three or more appointments if writing is a challenge for you.  Even
someone who already writes well can benefit from an expert opinion.

<p>
<B>Library:</B>  Don’t be shy about asking for help in the library.  Our library
contact for Design and Society is Sharon Elteto.  She will be the most familiar
with what we are doing.  But any of the librarians are happy to help with
questions, so if Sharon is not available just ask at the desk.  Also see the
<A HREF="http://www.lib.pdx.edu/instruction/survivalguide/index.htm">Research Survival Guide</A>.
