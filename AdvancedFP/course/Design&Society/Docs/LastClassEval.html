Early in the year I gave some advice. Was this good advice?

The first two weeks here at PSU will set the tone for the rest of the year, and perhaps even your whole college career. For many, college is a life transforming experience. Make the most of these two crucial weeks.

You are responsible for your success.  I don’t want excuses, but actions that provide remedies.

<p> Collected Advice for Freshman
<OL>
<LI> Goto class. <BR>
More than any other factor this is an indicator for success.
<LI> Its OK to take more than 4 years to graduate  <BR>
sometimes it’s a good idea!
<LI> Take classes at a rate at which you can do well in all of them. <BR>
12 credits of A’s and Bs, is much better than 15 credits of C’s and an F
<BR> Spend 2-3 hours on your own, studying or doing assignments, for every hour spent in class. <BR>
Exercise. How many hours a week are you expected to put in outside of class? The minimum? The maximum? Total hours including class time?
<LI> You are taking too many classes when you can’t get the homework done for all of them.  <BR>
If you wait until you’re flunking one of them IT IS TOO LATE. <BR>
Do something as soon as you can’t keep up. <BR>
