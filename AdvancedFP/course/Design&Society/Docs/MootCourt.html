<p>

The goal of this assignment is to research the Narmada Sagar
Dam project case, and to particpate in a Moot Court exercise.
For the purpose of our class, a moot court is a combination
of a debate and an improvisational play. The idea is show case the arguments both pro and con
for building the dam, as one might in a debate. But instead of
doing this in a debate format. Each team must loosely script a small
play, where the arguments are presented as they might have been
presented in a court case. 
<p>
Each student will role-play a part. The parts might include
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Judges
<LI> Lawyers
<LI> Expert witnesses (who testify on the merits of the bridge based
upon their expertise as engineers, geologists, social workers, doctors etc.).

<LI> Government policy makers.
<LI> Media or journalists (such as Roy).
<LI> Ordinary people affected by the dam
<LI> Environmentalists
<LI> Politicians
<LI> Governmental Agencies
<LI> etc.
</UL>
<p>
There will be two groups. Each group will perform a loosely scripted
improvisational play.
Each group is alloted 35 minutes. The characters
in the play should belong to different subgroups with different
perspectives (i.e. different stakeholders).
<p>
It is up to you to determine how much time each subgroup receives
testifying in the play.
<p>
It is up to you to assign people to different subgroups and roles.
<p>
This is a role-playing exercise.  Factual details
must be accurate, but there is some dramatic license
allowed. Small non-consequential details may be
"made up" to improve the performance. We want each
performance to be realistic. If you are representing the NBA
viewpoint you should speak as if you are a member of the NBA, such as
one of the villagers.
<p>

In addition to the performance, each group will provide a short (1-2 page)
program (or play-bill), where the scenes of the play are described, and the
arguments that the group is trying to make in each scene are outlined. The
purpose of this is to be sure the performance is not completely made up. It
should have a point, and a structure, and this struture is made clear in the
playbill. A copy of this playbill will be presented to both Liz and Tim at the
beginning of each performance.

<p>
I will grade the moot-court exercise using the following
rubric.

<p>

<UL>
<LI> Does the play show case a wide variety of viewpoints?
<LI> Does the testimony explore the issues accurately?
<LI> Does each side in the argument make its strongest arguments? We want a fair portrayal.
<LI> Does the testimony enlighten the audience into the subtleties of the issues?
<LI> Does the play clearly illustrate the stakeholders and their positions on the case?
<LI> Do the players seem believable?
<LI> Does the play illustrate that the group researched the issues. Including
some information outside the documents listed on the readings page.
<LI> Is the play-bill informative, and does it accurately describe the overall action
in the play. Are each of the arguments sufficiently summarized?

</UL>

<p>
For your information, I have included below some background information,
and part of the opinion of the court that first tried the case.
<p>
SOME BACKGROUND FROM THE MAJORITY OPINION OF THE COURT
<p>
In April, 1994 the petitioner filed the present writ petition inter
alia praying that the Union of India should be restrained from
proceeding with the construction of the dam and they should be ordered
to open the aforesaid sluices.... On 15th November, 1994, this Court
called for the report of the Five Member Group and the Government of
India was also directed to give its response to the said report.
<p>
CASE OF PETITIONERS
<p>
On behalf of the petitioners, the arguments of Sh. Shanti Bhushan,
learned senior counsel, were divided into four different heads,
namely, general issues, issues regarding environment, issues regarding
relief and rehabilitation and issues regarding review of Tribunal's
Award. The petitioners have sought to contend that it is necessary for
some independent judicial authority to review the entire project,
examine the current best estimates of all costs (social,
environmental, financial), benefits and alternatives in order to
determine whether the project is required in its present form in the
national interest or whether it needs to be restructured/ modified. It
is further the case of the petitioners that no work should proceed
till environment impact assessment has been fully done and its
implications for the projects viability being assessed in a
transparent and participatory manner. This can best be done, it is
submitted, as a part of the comprehensive review of the project.
<p>
While strongly championing the cause of environment and of the tribals
who are to be ousted as a result of submergence, it was submitted that
the environmental clearance which was granted in 1987 was without any
or proper application of mind as complete studies in that behalf were
not available and till this is done the project should not be allowed
to proceed further. With regard to relief and rehabilitation a number
of contentions were raised with a view to persuade this Court that
further submergence should not take place and the height of the dam,
if at all it is to be allowed to be constructed, should be
considerably reduced as it is not possible to have satisfactory relief
and rehabilitation of the oustees as per the Tribunal's Award as a
result of which their fundamental rights under Article 21 would be
violated.
<p>
While the State of Madhya Pradesh has partly supported the petitioners
in as much as it has also pleaded for reduction in the height of the
dam so as to reduce the extent of submergence and the consequent
displacement, the other States and the Union of India have refuted the
contentions  of the petitioners and of the State of Madhya Pradesh.
While accepting that initially the relief and rehabilitation had
lagged behind but now adequate steps have been taken to ensure proper
implementation of relief and rehabilitation at least as per the Award.
The respondents have, while refuting other allegations, also
questioned the bona fides of the petitioners in filing this petition.
It is contended that the cause of the tribals and environment is being
taken up by the petitioners not with a view to benefit the tribals but
the real reason for filing this petition is to see that a high dam is
not erected per se. It was also submitted that at this stage this
Court should not adjudicate on the various issues raised specially
those which have been decided by the Tribunal's Award.
