<BIG>Portfolio Review Process</BIG>
</CENTER>

<p> The portfolio review process is the primary way that we evaluate students’
learning related to the University Studies goals. That information helps us
identify strengths as well as areas for program improvement and faculty
development.

<p> While the portfolio is a required class assignment, participation in the
portfolio review process is strictly voluntary. The review happens after
grades have been submitted. Agreeing or declining will not affect a student’s
grade or relationship to PSU in any way.
     
<p> Portfolio review is "confidential", but not "anonymous". This means that
while the reviewers may sometimes see identifying information on the portfolio
(i.e., the student’s URL on an electronic portfolio), all scores are reported
without disclosing the identification of the student, and none of the reports
or summaries of the review ever mention students by name.
     
<p> While the primary use of the portfolio review data is program improvement,
the data may be used for other research purposes. For example, this year, we
have a research project under way that connects student responses from the
Prior Learning Assessment at the beginning of the year with information about
student retention and performance. We will use the portfolio scores in the
research project. We are interested in understanding how to improve student
retention and learning in the first year at PSU.
