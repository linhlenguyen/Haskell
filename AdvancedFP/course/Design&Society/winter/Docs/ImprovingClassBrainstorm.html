<p>
We brainstormed how we could improve the class this quarter.
The class broke into 6 groups. Each group came up with 3-5
ideas and reported back to the class.
The ideas were broken into two groups: 1) Things the staff
could do, and 2) Things the students could do. Here is a compilation
of the results.
