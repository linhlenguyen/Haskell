Put your name on the worksheet. _______________________________________

What is the title of the paper you are reading. _______________________

Here are several questions (originally suggested to me by 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~hook">James Hook</A>) that one should ask 
(and answer) when reading a paper. Use this page as a worksheet.
Print it out and write a few short sentences for each question.
It is quite probable that you can answer some
of these questions before you've read the whole paper.
Fill in the answers to those questions as soon as
you think you know the answer.
