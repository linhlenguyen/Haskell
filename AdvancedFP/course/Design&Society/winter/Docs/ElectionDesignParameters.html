<p>
We brain-stormed about some possible design paramters for a new election
system. Here are some of the ideas we came up with.
<p>
<UL>
<LI> Replace the electoral college
<LI> Money plays only a small role
<LI> No nepotism
<LI> No TV ads
<LI> Encourage a more than 2 party system
<LI> encourage a no-party system
<LI> age cut off (80?)
<LI> Fair - every vote counts equally
<LI> Right to vote is protected (for everyone over 18)
<LI> Everyone who runs gets their name on the ballot
<LI> Encouage people to vote.    mandatory, pay, rewards, lottery
<LI> Election day should be a holiday
<LI> Encourage a diversity of candidates
</UL>
<p>

Here is a reconstructionist approach to a set of design parameters
that might have led to the current system.
<p>
<UL>

<LI> Drags out the elcetion process for 2 or more years.
<LI> Makes television ads the primaruy means of communicationg with voters.
<LI> Gives some states in inordinate influence, and disenfranchises others.
<LI> Makes chasing money the most important goal.
<LI> Allows party insiders to hijack the outcome.
<LI> Strengthens the propoenents of fringe issues.
<LI> Sets up binary thinking.
<LI> Marginalizes important issues.
<LI> Is manipulated by the media to create headlines, rather than substantive debate of the issues.
</UL>
