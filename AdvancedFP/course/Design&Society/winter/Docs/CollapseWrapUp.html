If there is one lesson to learn from reading collapse is that
the past has something to teach us. Diamond has an agenda
and I believe his agenda is that "History can inform policy">
<p>
I.e. if we study history carefully, it can (and should)
influence the decisions we make today.
<p>
Diamond's technique can be summed up as follows:
<OL>
<LI> Study the past
<LI> Make hypothesis about why things happened
<LI> Perform experiments (mostly comparative studies)
<LI> Refine hypothesis so that accounts for things you might not firat have anticipated.
<LI> Use validated hypothesis to inform policy.
</OL>
<P>        
How can we applying Collapse ideas to our own lives?

<LI>Which example of civilizational collapse described in the book do
you find most compelling and why? Which best fits Diamond’s thesis? Diamond
notes that "no other site that I have visited made such a ghostly impression
on me as Rano Raraku, the quarry on Easter Island" (p. 79). Which image or
passage in the book made the most powerful impression on you?

<LI> There is a lot of talk these days about how environmentalists have
damaged their credibility by crying wolf -- for example, issuing dire
warnings about exploding population and the effects of global warming that
have not been borne out. Do you think Diamond is vulnerable to the charge of
crying wolf in Collapse? If not, why not? How does his argument and approach
differ from alarmist environmentalists?

<LI>Diamond describes Tikopia as a kind of island paradise where natives
saved their environment through eco-friendly gardening and devised a kind of
rudimentary democratic system of government. Yet Tikopians also practiced
infanticide and abortion to limit population growth. What does this say
about our ability to judge the morality of past societies? Can one (must
one?) differentiate between macro- and micro-morality?

<li>Diamond writes that our world "cannot sustain China and other Third
World countries and current First World countries all operating at First
World levels" (p. 376). Yet how can we ethically deny Third World countries
the comforts and advantages that we in the First World enjoy? In your
opinion, what should our leaders do to lessen or resolve looming conflicts
over resources between First and Third World countries?

<LI>If the United States does collapse, how do you think it will happen?
Which of Diamond’s five factors would play a role in the demise of American
civilization as we know it? Do you think our collapse will occur suddenly,
like the crash of Easter Island or Maya civilization, or is it more likely
that we’ll experience a gradual but stable decline, as Great Britain did
after World War II? 
<BR><BR><BR>


<LI>Diamond reveals that while writing the book he found himself
lurching between hope and despair. What emotions did Collapse inspire in
you? Did you come away depressed, cautiously hopeful, or did you have an
entirely different reaction?
