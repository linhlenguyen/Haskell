My Friends!

I am very sick -- fever, chills, headache, etc.  In an
effort to recover from this flu and to keep from
infecting others, I am staying at home.  Please still
convene for mentor session.  Below is an outline/agenda
of what to accomplish. Please feel free to accomplish
these activities in an order that makes sense to the
group at large.
<p>

After class, please collect the posters people have
made in main session.
<p>

Bring the posters to the mentored inquiry room and
borrow some tape so that you can hang them on the
walls.
<p>

Then, in teams of three (possibly your teams for the
Collapse presentation), consider the posters.
<p>

<B>Activity 1</B><BR>
<p>

Analysis:  Pick 2 to 4 posters on which to focus your
analysis.  Study the main points on analyze the
posters.  Are there points that are missing?  Are there
points that could be further broken down?  What
patterns do you notice?
<p>

Synthesis:  After analyzing the main points, talk with
your teammates about possible ways in which the ideas
from one poster may be connected to ideas from another
poster/s. As a team, you should generate at least 5
possible connections.
<p>
Presentation:  After deciding on 3 possible
connections, work together to write a description of
the connections you found and why you think they are
valid and important.  Post this writing to the WebCt
Discussion Board.  Give the post a good title.  Make
sure everyone’s name from the team is included in the
post, so other people know who collaborated on the
ideas.
<p>

<B>Activity 2</B> <BR>
<p>
Peer Review. Print a peer review sheet out from the
Daily Record.  Complete the sheet for the paper given
to you by Professor Sheard.  Bring this paper and your
review to class on Wednesday.
<p>

<B>Activity 3</B> <BR>
<p>
Take attendance. Have everyone sign in on a piece of
paper, then one person can be responsible for bringing
this sheet to class on Wednesday.
