webpage on which you will post an essay addressing your progress
toward these goals as well as links to samples of your work.
Please note that linking to copies your work is not enough: you
must make an argument about why this piece of work represents your
progress toward the goal. This will be tru about the larger
Spring term portfolio as well.
