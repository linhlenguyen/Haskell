<p>
In this worksheet you will compare and contrast the views exhibited
in
<UL>
<LI> The <A HREF="DesignManifesto.jpg">Design Manifesto</A>, and 
<LI> The movie <A HREF="http://thenextindustrialrevolution.org/">The Next Industrial Revolution</A>
</UL>
<p>
These two works are closely aligned. For this worksheet pick three of the Design Manifesto points
and compare the ideas behind these points with the opinions expressed in the movie.
For each of the three, clearly state what the idea is, how the two works agree or disagree,
and why you think the authors of the two works hold the opinions they do. Finally,
clearly explain where your own opinion stands. 
<p>
<B>HINT:</B> read carefully chapter 1 "They Say" pp 17-27 from the text "They Say, I Say".
You should use the techniques discussed here in each of your three points.
