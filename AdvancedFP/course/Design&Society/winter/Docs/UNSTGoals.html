<p>
Freshman Inquiry courses.  The goals are to develop those skills that will
be crucial to your academic success and beyond.  The four major learning
goals of University Studies are:

<UL>
 <LI> <B>Inquiry and Critical Thinking</B> <br>
      Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary
      curricula problem-posing, investigating, conceptualizing in order to
      become active, self-motivated, and empowered learners.

 <LI> <B>Communication</B> <br>
      Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various
      ways -- writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means to
      collaborate effectively with others in group work, and to be competent
      in appropriate communication technologies.


 <LI> <B>The Variety of Human Experience</B> <br>
      Students will enhance their appreciation for and understanding of the
      rich complexity of the human experience through the study of
      differences in ethnic and cultural perspectives, class, race, gender,
      sexual orientation, and ability.


 <LI> <B>Ethical Issues and Social Responsibility</B> <br>
      Students will expand their understanding of the impact and value of
      individuals and their choices on society, both intellectually and
      socially, through group projects and collaboration in learning
      communities.
