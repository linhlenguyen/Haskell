<p> The purpose of this in-class assignment is to review your progress towards
acheiving the Goal you wrote about in the 
<A HREF="../fall/Assignments/writing01.html">first writing assignment</A> in the Fall
quarter.
<p>
I will hand out a copy of your essay, so that you can review what you
wrote last quarter.


<ul>
<LI> Write about 1 page in class.
<LI> Outline the Goal, and the 2 strategies you choose in your original paper.
<LI> Write about the progress you have made towards acheiving your goal.

them. 
<ol>
