<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to create an Annotated bibliography for the 
winter quarter <A HREF="ResearchPaper.html">research paper</A>.
You should begin by browsing the <A HREF="../Docs/KatrinaReadingList.html">Katrina Reading list</A>,
visiting the library, and using the internet to identify some sources.

<p>
After reading a number of sources, compile a bibliography of books and journal articles that you might
use to research your topic, format it in the MLA style.
<p>
This bibliography must include at least four sources in addition to
the textbook(s), and at least two scholarly (peer reviewed journals or
books).  
<p>
Each item in an annotated bibliography (for this class) has the following
pieces.
<OL>
<LI> A bibliography record formatted in MLA style.
<LI> A brief (2-3 sentence) description or synopsis of what the work is about.
<LI> At least 1 (possibly many) quotations, that you might use in the
paper you will be writing.
</OL>
Here is an example entry I wrote about the Richard Smith's review of
Jared Diamond's book <I>Collapse</I>. Your annotated bibliography
will have many such entries.

<SMALL>Richard Smith. "Capitalism and Collapse: 
  contradictions of Jared Diamond’s market meliorist strategy to save the humans." 
Capitalism Nature Socialism Journal. 16.4(December 2005):
19 - 36. Electronic Journal sources at <A HREF="http://www.cnsjournal.org/">http://www.cnsjournal.org/</A>
<p>
A review of Jared Diamonds book <I>Collapse</I>. Basically agrees
with most of Diamond's analysis of why societies suceed or fail,
but disagrees strongly with Diamond's analysis of the lessons
we should learn from this study. Argues that most societies
can not choose certain paths because they were controlled
by small autocratic groups beyond the control of most
of societies members. That this state has much in common
with our own world, where big money and corporations are 
in control, and if we are to avoid the fate of many of
these past societies, we will need to exert more control
over these entities.

"Diamond’s thesis is that societies such as the Easter Islanders,
the Greenland Norse, the Anasazi of the American southwest, the
Lowland Mayans and others collapsed largely because they exhausted
the natural resources on which they depended and failed to realize
the need to change, or, inexplicably, refused to change and instead
pursued <I>grim trajectories</I> toward social and economic
disintegration and collapse."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Diamond has opened a fruitful approach to understanding the
dynamics of eco-social collapse. Indeed, I think it’s the most
important history lesson in his book. But the problem is that when
he turns to our modern predicament, he completely <I>forgets</I> his own
lesson."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"But we don’t live in a <I>bottom-up</I> democratic society. We live in a
capitalist society in which ownership and control of the economy is
largely in the hands of private corporations who pursue their own
ends and don’t answer to society"

Some advice about formatting and annotating bibliographys can be found at the following
web sites. 
The <A HREF="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/handouts/research/index.html">OWL</A> project
(and especially its <A HREF="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/01/">page</A> about annotated bibliographies),
and the <A HREF="http://www.liunet.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workshop/citmla.htm">liunet</A> website.

As a quide to formatting bibliographic references, I have included
the following examples (from the OWL project page).
