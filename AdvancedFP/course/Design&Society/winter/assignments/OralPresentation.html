Some guidlines for Presentation preparation.

<UL>
<LI> A presentation is a tool that helps you explain to others what you have done. 
Most of the information is in your comments. The poster gives you something to refer to, and reminds you of important points.

<LI>Keep visuals simple and uncluttered
<LI>Restrict text to 4-8 lines per page.   
<LI>Use color and font changes to carry a message (e.g. related concepts or experimental results in the same colors), not arbitrarily.
<LI>Use LARGE fonts. 
<LI>Use graphics rather than words where possible.
<LI>Put keywords on poster to help you remember script.
</UL>
