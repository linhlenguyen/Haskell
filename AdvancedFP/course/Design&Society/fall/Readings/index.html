Some of the readings below come from the required texts. Some are pdf
documents you can download and print. One way to download and print a pdf
document is to right click on the link, and then save the files in a place
you can access them. You can open them using <A HREF=

is a free tool which you can get from many places.

your name, the title of the reading, the author, and an excerpt
you found interesting. On the back of the card you should list a few
notes: what you thought were the main points, questions you had, etc.
