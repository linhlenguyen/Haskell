The point of the exercise is use the written comments
provided by me on assignment 1 to improve your paper.

You should also apply the "Core Rules of Writing", and get at least
one other person to read your re-written draft. Use their
comments as well to improve your second draft, to create
a third draft. Hand in this third draft.

You must paste a copy of the rules on your monitor as you write the
