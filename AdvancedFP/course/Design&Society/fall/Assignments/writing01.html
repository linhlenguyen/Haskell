<H1>What</H1> Following the pattern given for Tim Sheard's Goals, type a 1 page document (in 12 point font) in which you
describe 2 personal goals for the fall quarter.

See <A HREF="../Notes/L01FactsOfLife.ppt">lecture 1</A> posted
on the "Notes" section of the class web-page, if you've
forgotten what they look like.
<p>
In addition to listing
the goals, you must include several strategies for attaining each goal.
Your document should use full sentences, paragraphs, correct punctuation,
and English grammar.
<p>
Goals can be any personal goal, associated with PSU, Design and Society,
or any other activity you choose. You are graded on your
ability to express your ideas clearly (see the grading rubric)
not the activity you choose.

<H1>When</H1>
Assigned: Monday September 24, 2007.
Due: In class, Wednesday, September 26, 2007.

<H1>Special Instructions</H1>
You must keep an electronic version of this document on
the PSU computers for future reference and use.
Ideally it should be on your 'H' drive, but for today
any location you can access via the computers in the
Mentor  lab (i.e. on the web, or emailed to yourself, or on
web page you can cut and paste from, or on a key drive, etc.)
is acceptable.
