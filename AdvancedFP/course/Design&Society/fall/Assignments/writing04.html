<H1>What</H1>

<B>Assignment:</B>  Design an object using the defined design process, careful user
observation, and principles of Universal Design.  Document your design and
create a display board to be shown at a class design show.

<HR ALIGN="center" WIDTH="100%">


Relationship to University Studies Goals:

<UL>

<LI> <U>Critical Thinking: </U>
<OL>  <LI> Look critically at the objects which we use in our daily life.  Consider
      the intended purpose, constraints, design features, and how effectively the
      object has been designed to achieve those design goals.

     <LI> Identify aspects of good and poor design in those objects.

     <LI> Use that understanding combined with class exercises to identify a need
     (or desire) in your life for a new product, or an improvement of an existing
     object.

     <LI> Consciously use a defined Design Process to generate and improve a
     design.

</OL>

<LI> <U>Diversity: </U>
<OL> <LI> By applying knowledge of different human abilities and disabilities and using Universal Design Principles you will create a design which can be used by the greatest number of people possible.  Use objective observations of various real people to determine design criteria.
</OL>

<LI> <U>Communication: </U>
<OL> <LI> Clearly document both the design itself and the outcomes of intermediate
     design process steps using a written report, sketches or images, and
     tabulation.

     <LI> Create a display board for your product considering the intended
     meanings of the images chosen.  Use images to communicate ideas without
     relying only on text.

     <LI> All written output must be in a Word document.  Scanned sketches and/or
computer generated images are preferred, but it is OK to attach hand drawn
sketches. </OL>

    person.

    <LI> Note any object that you would like to have, that is not currently
    available.

    <LI> Feel free to talk to others for ideas or feedback.

    <LI> Keep this idea list or bug list in your journal as well as any sketches.

    <LI> Turn in a list of five to ten objects that need improvement or need to be
    designed.  Or, if the object doesn’t exist just state the problem.
     <OL>
       <LI> For each object explain the problem in the most general form possible.  Example “I want to get fresh air into my bedroom without letting pollen in because it causes allergies.”  NOT “I want to design a window screen.”

    statement for that design problem</B>.
      <UL>
        <LI>Focus on the task or action.   If you are focusing on the object you have
            probably already assumed a solution.

        <LI>Do not assume a solution.  You should never say, "I’m going to design a ..."


        <LI>Bad statement:   I want to design a cool car with only 2 wheels.

        <LI>Decent statement:  Design a means for short distance travel in the city
        that uses little fuel and requires little space to park.

        <LI>Decent statement:  I live too far to make bicycling practical but do
        not want the expense of a car and do not want to use much gas.

        <LI>Better statement and problem:  To make bike riding in the city more
        safe I need a better way to see the cars around me without turning around.

        <LI>Bad statement:  Design a rear-view mirror for a bicycle.  (Assumes

         like IDEO’s shopping cart, or will you be going into someone’s home or
         room?)

         <LI>How are you going to document the results?  It should be photos unless
         it is prohibitively difficult.  Some notes will be needed as well.

         <LI>You need to observe at least three people in detail not including
         yourself.

         <LI>If the observation plan isn’t practical ("Observe three people taking
         showers ...") then you’ll need a different problem statement.

written problem statement with explanation as to motivation and goals, and a
specific and complete observation plan.

Turn in documentation of observations (photographs and/or descriptions),
conclusions based on those observations, and a list of at least 8 criteria.
<UL>

  <LI><B>Observation</B>:  observe at least 3 people.  You can also observe yourself if
  you can be objective.
    <UL>
      <LI>Observe the behaviors of users and how they interact
      with the object and their environment.

    <UL>
       <LI>Photographs.  If the user does not want to be photographed you

       object(s) with photos.

       <LI>Written descriptions of behavior, about one short paragraph
       for each observation.  Things to consider:
          <UL>
             <LI>What is the task?  Consider the GOAL.  Similar to the problem
             statement.

             <LI>What are the methods?  A flowchart can be helpful.

             <LI>Where are the tasks performed?  Is this always the same?

             <LI>What other tools are used?

             <LI>How often is this done?

   from this exercise?  One paragraph.

   <LI><B>Criteria</B> for evaluating design.
     <UL>
       <LI>Must include Universal Design criteria.  Those
       should be restated in a way that applies to the problem
       at hand.

       <LI>What does flexibility in use mean in this case?
       For my fresh air solution it could mean working in
       different windows.  It should also provide for use by
       users of different capabilities.

       <LI>Must include cost and could include some aesthetic
       measurement.

       <LI>Must comprehend user needs identified above (at least 2 in addition to Universal Design criteria)

       <LI>Overall you should have at least 8 criteria.
    </UL>

   <LI><B>Grading</B>:  Five points for clear documentation of observations (photos,
   sketches, or detailed descriptions) and the conclusions you have drawn from
   them.  Five points for generating eight criteria clearly linked to observations
   and Universal Design.  You must include most Universal Design principles and
   restate in a more specific manner.

<U><B>Part 3 Visualize Evaluate and Refine</B>:  Generate alternative
design ideas.  Evaluate using defined criteria</U>.
 <UL>
   <LI>Generate at least five design alternatives.
     <UL>
       <LI>A design alternative is a fully realized design, not a feature
       of a design.
          <UL>
            <LI>Example:  wheels are a feature of a backpack design.  If you
                want to consider wheels you should sketch out a full backpack
                including wheels.
          </UL>

       <LI>One of these can be an existing product used as a reference.
       The others should be unique in at least one respect.

       <LI>Each design alternative should be numbered and named for ease
       of reference.

       <LI>Most alternatives will need a sketch, however at times a
       description may be sufficient.

       <LI>Sketches do not need to be artistic, but should indicate key
       features.
     </UL>

   <LI>Use the Pugh matrix attached to compare the various
   alternatives and identify the optimum design.  Type it in.
     <UL>
       <LI>If what you considered your “best” design doesn’t “win” you
       should re-evaluate the results.  Should you weight something
       more heavily?  Did you forget one aspect?  If so, do another
       matrix.

       <LI>Should your final design include some features from the other
       alternatives?
    </UL>

   <LI>Write a brief conclusion.  Which design was the best and why?
    How close is it to meeting your goals?

   <LI>Turn in sketches and descriptions of your five designs, a
   completed Pugh matrix, and a conclusion based on the Pugh
   results

  <UL>
    <LI>Documentation will include the documentation of the previous
    steps in the process as well as the final result.

    <LI>If you did a thorough job on the preceding steps you can just
    insert them into the final document with just a few additions.

    <LI>Include:
       <UL>
         <LI>Idea list, and the reasons for selecting a particular problem.
         It should involve some personal reflection as well as more
         objective reasons.  Why choose this problem?

         <LI>Problem statement.

         <LI>User observations.

         <LI>Pugh matrix, with clear and succinct descriptions of the
         design criteria and design alternatives.
      </UL>

   <LI>Document final design.
     <UL>
        <LI>May be one of previous alternatives, but may be modified.

        <LI>Probably requires a sketch.  Does require a brief description.

        <LI>Add enough details to the description of the chosen design to
        clearly explain important features and how those features
        satisfy the criteria.
    </UL>

   <LI>Grading:  50 points.  Problem Statement/Motivation (5),
   Observations and Criteria (10), Alternatives (10), Evaluation
   and conclusions (5), Sketch and description of final design (20)
