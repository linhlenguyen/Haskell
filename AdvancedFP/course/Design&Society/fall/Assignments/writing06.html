<H1>What</H1>
Add an outline to your thesis statement. Use the ideas
you generated in class Oct 24.
Your outline should have at least 3 top-level ideas.
Each idea should be expanded at least one level, with
3-4 sub-topics in the outline. An example of this is found below.

Thesis:

<PRE>
Although at first it seems that the IDEO design process as
portrayed in the "Deep Dive" is complete,   on closer inspections
it is clear that it is insufficient to bring a product from
conception to market.

A.  Describe the Ideo Process
        1. Defining Features/Characteristics of IDEO process:
                Team Based
                Observation rather than interview (observe rather than ask)
                Iterative--look at things and then go back and look at then again (repeat)
                Depends on construction of prototypes
                Best ideas rise from consensus
        2.  What is it not...
                hierarchical (ideas don't come from the top)
                not market research

        3.Non-traditional Techniques
                Brainstorming
                No idea too silly
                        eg: airplane wing in the office
                        privacy wall in the shopping cart
                Culture of Freedom in the office
                Failure isn't disaster it teaches you something

B.  Identify its strengths and weaknessesB
        1. Strengths
               Creative
               Breadth of Ideas
        2. Weaknesses
                good teams are hard to form
                expensive
                focuses on the early phase of the early phase of design
                ignores the later stages ie: manufacturing

C.  Identify and Describe what's missing
        1.  As identified by Ilan Sabar in his electric skateboard presentation
                how do you manufacture the parts?
                What processes do you use?
                What costs?
                Domestic vs Foreign Suppliers
                How do you find the buyers?
                How do you test for durability, safety,etc.?

D.  Proposes Modifications to improve the Ideo Design Process
        1.  Include manufacturing considerations early in the design process.
        2.  Include marketing considerations early in the design process.
        3.  Include testing  considerations early in the design process.

Be sure that your final product conatins both a thesis statement
and an organized outline.
