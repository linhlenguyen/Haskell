<U><B>Part 3 Visualize Evaluate and Refine</B>:  Generate alternative
design ideas.  Evaluate using defined criteria</U>.
 <UL>
   <LI>Generate at least five design alternatives.
     <UL>
       <LI>A design alternative is a fully realized design, not a feature
       of a design.
          <UL>
            <LI>Example:  wheels are a feature of a backpack design.  If you
                want to consider wheels you should sketch out a full backpack
                including wheels.
          </UL>

       <LI>One of these can be an existing product used as a reference.
       The others should be unique in at least one respect.

       <LI>Each design alternative should be numbered and named for ease
       of reference.

       <LI>Most alternatives will need a sketch, however at times a
       description may be sufficient.

       <LI>Sketches do not need to be artistic, but should indicate key
       features.
     </UL>

   <LI>Use the Pugh matrix attached to compare the various
   alternatives and identify the optimum design.  Type it in.
     <UL>
       <LI>If what you considered your “best” design doesn’t “win” you
       should re-evaluate the results.  Should you weight something
       more heavily?  Did you forget one aspect?  If so, do another
       matrix.

       <LI>Should your final design include some features from the other
       alternatives?
    </UL>

   <LI>Write a brief conclusion.  Which design was the best and why?
    How close is it to meeting your goals?

   <LI>Turn in sketches and descriptions of your five designs, a
   completed Pugh matrix, and a conclusion based on the Pugh
   results
