<U><B>Part 1:  Understand</B>:  Idea Generation, Object Selection, Problem Statement,
Observation Plan</U>. <BR>

You will turn in 1 paper, but it will have three
sections. Be sure you turn in all 3 sections

<OL>
  <LI> Turn in the idea list including a one sentence explanation for
each. 25%
  <LI> Pick one of these, as the object you will design. Clearly state
    which object you have chosen, and describe in not more than 3-4 sentences why you choose this object over the other ideas.
    Give the problem statement for the chosen design. 25%
  <LI> Turn in a user observation plan. This plan tells how you will
      observe people in your effort to understand how to design
      your chosen object.  Give some concrete
      strategies you will employ. You will actually do this observation
      next week between Mon-Wed, so be sure your plan fits with this time frame.
      This section has considerable worth 50%. Put some effort into this.
</OL>

<P>

<U>Some Guidance on Idea generation</U>
  <UL>
    <LI>Pay attention to the objects that you and the others around you use.

    <LI>Make note of any object that causes frustration, doesn’t work well, or is
    difficult to use.  Do NOT assume that the source of the difficulty might be the
    person.

    <LI> Note any object that you would like to have, that is not currently
    available.

    <LI> Feel free to talk to others for ideas or feedback.

    <LI> Keep this idea list or bug list in your journal as well as any sketches.

    <LI> Turn in a list of five to ten objects that need improvement or need to be
    designed.  Or, if the object doesn’t exist just state the problem.
     <OL>
       <LI> For each object explain the problem in the most general form possible.  Example “I want to get fresh air into my bedroom without letting pollen in because it causes allergies.”  NOT “I want to design a window screen.”
       <LI> You may need to explain the problem with existing solutions.
     </OL>
