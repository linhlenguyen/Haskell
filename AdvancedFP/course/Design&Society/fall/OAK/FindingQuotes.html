<LI> On a clean piece of paper, identify the concept you want to support with a quote. Write a
sentence that clearly states the point you are trying to make.

<LI> Find a quote that supports this idea. Copy it onto the paper.
Be sure and include enough information about the quote that you can properly cite it later
(Title, author, editor, journal, volume, page, etc.).

<LI> Write down a short sentence or two that describes the
context in which the author uses the quote. What point was he trying to make?
Is there important contextual information that might help readers
understand the quote.

<LI> Make a list of reasons this quote supports your thesis. Put as many ideas
down as you can.

<LI> Play devils advocate. Write down reasons others might think it does
not support your thesis. Do you have a counter argument to refute these
reasons? If so, write these down as well.
