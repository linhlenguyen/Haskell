<LI> Is the thesis sentence a strong one?
The booklet <I>Ways of Writing</I> suggests that thesis statements
can be improved if they:
  <UL>
  <LI> Make no debatebale claim ("This paper will examine the pros and cons of death.")
  <LI> Are obvious, or a statement of fact ("Death is scary.")
  <LI> Offer a personal belief or folk wisdom claim ("A positive attitude will help you succeed.")
  <LI> Make an overly broad claim ("Sex is a yaboo subject in America".)
  </UL>
<p>
If the thesis sentence is weak. Point out why. Suggest a way to stregthen it.

<p>
<LI> Do the ideas in the outline flow together to make a unifiable whole.
Read just the top-level bullets. Do they tell a complete story?
If not point out why. Do they leave unanswered questions in your mind? If
they do, write the questions down so the outline's author can address them.

<p>
<LI> In 3 or 4 sentences, reiterate in your own words, what you think the
paper is about, and how the author will prove their claim. (I ask the writing
coach to do this summary, so that the author can judge if he has expressed his
intent clearly. If your idea of the paper and the author's (own) idea of the
paper differ widely, this tells the author something.)
