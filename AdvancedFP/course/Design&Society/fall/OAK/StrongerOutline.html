<BIG>Strengthening Your Outline</BIG>
</CENTER>
<p> This activity is intended to help you strengthen your outline, and hence strengthen the structure of your paper.
Remember the full paper is due in 9 days. If you are to have time to
polish your paper you will need a full draft of your paper very soon.

<OL>
<LI> Look at each item in your outline. Most of these
items will correspond to one or more paragraphs in your paper.
On a separate piece of paper, write a one sentence description
for each item. You should organize this paper with the same
structure as your outline.

<LI> Now, on your outline paper, label each item with the role it plays
in your paper. Example roles (from the PSU Writing Center's booklet <I>Ways of Writing</I>) might include.
  <UL>
        <LI> introduces
        <LI> describes
        <LI> explains
        <LI> gives examples
        <LI> defines
        <LI> proposes
        <LI> lists
        <LI> questions
        <LI> concludes
        <LI> etc.
  </UL>

<LI> Now analyze and count the different roles. Do you have
some items that are examples? Do you have an introduction, conclusion?
Do you have too many items playing one role, and not enough playing
others?

<LI> Go back and identify where items need to be added or removed.
If you add an item, remember to write a 1 sentence description.

<LI> Now, redo your complete outline. Use the 1 sentence descriptions
to help you fill the outline out.
