--- Chapter 6: "Men Without Name or Family"

1) The stone masons who actually built the dome were "Men Without Name
or Family". What do you think the author means by this description?
Point out 3 passages that support your claim (use a quote for each).

Chapter 7: "Some Unheard-of Machine"

Brunelleschi's crane was reversible. It could both lift and lower. Why
was this important? How was this accomplished? No one knows exactly
where he got his ideas. Speculate about two possibilities. Point to
passages in this and earlier chapters that support your speculation.

--- Chapter 8: "The Chain of Stone"

The dome incorporates several chains of stone (and wood) that
completely encircle it at diffferent heights. Does the book explain
why they were important? Point to several passages in this and
earlier chaptersthat support your claim.

--- Chapter 9: "The Tale of the Fat Carpenter"

The books hints that Brunelleschi uses a ploy to discredit his rival
Lorenzo Ghiberti. What is the ploy? What evidence does the author use
to support his claim? Do you believe the author?

-- Chapter 10: "The Pointed Fifth"

What is the problem in dome construction that this chapter tries to
explain? Do we know how Brunelleschi solved it?

--- Chapter 11: "Bricks and Mortar"

Brunelleschi devised a clever mechanism to keep the bricks from
sliding inward as the dome rose higher and the angle at which the
bricks lay increased. What was this mechanism? Point to 2 passages
that suggest where he might have gotten his ideas?

--- Chapter 12: "Circle by Circle"

For the second time, the author devotes a chapter to the circular
chains in the dome. He must think these features are important.
Speculate on why he doies this. Point to two passages that support
your claim.
