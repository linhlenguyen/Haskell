<H1>Course Description </H1>

Designers influence the creation of products, images, infrastructure and
environments surrounding us, both virtual and real. Acting in a deliberate
manner, designers engage with the problems facing their communities, and act
to solve them by developing pragmatic, creative and innovative solutions.
This course will use designers’ activities as an analogy for individuals in
other disciplines; in the end, everyone is a designer as they determine the
context and direction of their life. Using design as our focus, we will
explore individual responsibilities toward society: How can we act to bridge
the gap between design and ecological sustainability? How can individuals
acting locally compete within the global economy? Using hands-on activities,
case studies, and historical investigations, we will explore techniques for
design, visualization, and creative problem solving, and share our visions
for a future where designing, and by extension all activity, occurs in
harmony with natural systems.

<H1>Course Website</H1>
There are two pages of interest to the class
<OL>
   <LI> WebCT:  <A HREF="http://www.webct.pdx.edu/">http://www.webct.pdx.edu/</A>
   <br>
   This course
   utilizes WebCT to extend your learning environment beyond the classroom. You
   will be using WebCT for continuing the discussions beyond the classroom, in
   creating a digital portfolio, submitting your assignments and accessing
   additional readings posted by your instructor. All changes to the course
   syllabus and additional assignments will be posted on the course website.
   If you have an ODIN account and are registered for the class you will be
   given a WebCT account.  Your name and password are the same as your ODIN
   account.

   <br>
   The class webpage maintains a "<A HREF="http://www.cs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/Frinq/DailyRecord.html">Daily Record</A>" which catalogs every class activity.
   Activities include lectures, mentor-sessions, reading assignments, writing assignments,
   projects, etc. These are catalogued by day, both when they are assigned
   and when they are due. You should check the daily record before every
   class. Hopefully the material here will be the same as the material
   on WebCT, except here it is organized by day, not by type of activity.

</UL>



<H1>Mentor Sessions</H1>

Mentor sessions are an integral part of the course and provide an array of
learning experiences that will enable you to succeed in this course.
Attendance and participation will be part of your grade.


<H1>Term Portfolio</H1>

At the end of Spring term you will submit a portfolio showing your work and
demonstrating your progress against University Studies Goals. The fall portfolio
may be waived, the winter portfolio will be a <A HREF="winter/Docs/MiniPortfolio.html"><I>mini-portfolio</I></A>, the spring
(end of the year) portfolio, must be a web page and will be cumulative, and must
contain materials from all three quarters. So save ALL your work both
electronically and in hard copy at least until the end of the year.  The spring
term portfolio will contain a final essay.

<H1>University Studies Goals</H1>

Inquiry based student learning is the cornerstone of the University Studies’
Freshman Inquiry courses.  The goals are to develop those skills that will
be crucial to your academic success and beyond.  The four major learning
goals of University Studies are:

<UL>
 <LI> <B>Inquiry and Critical Thinking</B> <br>
      Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary
      curricula problem-posing, investigating, conceptualizing  in order to
      become active, self-motivated, and empowered learners.

 <LI> <B>Communication</B> <br>
      Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various
      ways -- writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means to
      collaborate effectively with others in group work, and to be competent
      in appropriate communication technologies.


 <LI> <B>The Variety of Human Experience</B> <br>
      Students will enhance their appreciation for and understanding of the
      rich complexity of the human experience through the study of
      differences in ethnic and cultural perspectives, class, race, gender,
      sexual orientation, and ability.


 <LI> <B>Ethical Issues and Social Responsibility</B> <br>
      Students will expand their understanding of the impact and value of
      individuals and their choices on society, both intellectually and
      socially, through group projects and collaboration in learning
      communities.
</UL>

The goals themselves, as well as grading rubrics used by instructors
to evaluate if students have met these goals can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.pdx.edu/unst/goals.html">http://www.pdx.edu/unst/goals.html</A>

<H1>Design and Society Learning Goals</H1>

By the end of this course students should be able to:

<UL>
  <LI> Apply the steps in the design process to create original designs.

  <LI> Understand the interdisciplinary nature of the design process.

  <LI> Describe how design can improve social and physical systems and
  explain the societal responsibilities of the designer in areas such as
  sustainable development and social justice.

  <LI> Demonstrate mathematics skills, including application of basic
  physical laws to contextual problems, testing the functionality of
  designs, setting and meeting benchmark requirements.

  <LI> Analyze a design in terms of the context of the systems in which it
  operates - human interaction with the design, cultural context, natural
  harmony, and technical functionality

  <LI> Design and solve problems in a team-based culture using effective
  communication, cooperation, trust and respect. Take advantage of
  individual thinking styles and cultural diversity to strengthen a team.

</UL>

<H1>Grading and Assignments </H1>

and 4) an on-line final portfolio.  We'll also have almost weekly 
reading assignments and reading comprehension activities (quizzes, work-sheets, discussions)
and several short (1-2 page) writing assignments.  Course grade will be based
roughly on the following, however changes to assignments may change this
somewhat.

<UL>

    <OL>
       <LI> Attendance (7%)
       <LI> Reading Comprehension Activities (quizzes, work-sheets, etc) (6%)
       <LI> Class Preparation activities (reading notes, 1st drafts, products for peer review, etc) (6%)

    </OL>

  <LI> 75% Assignments and Projects including, but not limited to:
  <OL>  <LI> Individual presentation (10%)

</UL>

Please save your work throughout the year. You will need it for the
preparing a cumulative portfolio each quarter.  Your Mentor records
your mentor session participation and attendance and has direct
input in your grade. Final grade is assigned by the instructor.
<p>

Work not turned in, unacceptable work or an absence from class when
the work was done receives no credit. In addition if more than five
classes (main and/or mentor) are missed the quarter grade will be
reduced by one full letter grade.  You will be marked absent for the
day if you miss more than ten minutes of class. You will receive a
failing grade if you miss a total of 10 instructor lead classes or
mentor sessions or a combination thereof, despite your grades on
work completed.
<p>

Readiness to learn means that you will come to class with questions
and insights to offer to others and be prepared to discuss the
assigned reading.  We will be learning from each other and your
voice is important.  Your participation grade will include
attendance, participation in class discussions, participation in
online discussions, and group work in class on smaller design
problems and case studies.
