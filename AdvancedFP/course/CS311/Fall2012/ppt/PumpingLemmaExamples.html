This is an in class exercise.
<p>
For each problem, choose a partner, and then
solve the problem by using the pummping lemma.
<p>
Write down the proof for the problem on a sheet of paper.
<p>
We will discuss solutions for each problem, before moving on to the next problem.
<p>
You should use a different partner for each problem.

<ol>
<li>
Show that L1 = {0<sup>m</sup>1<sup>m</sup> | m &ge; 0} is not regular. {"",01,0011,000111, ...}


<li>
Show that L2 = {xx | x &isin;  {0, 1}<SUP>*</SUP>} is not regular. {"",00,11,0000,0101,1010,1111, ...}

<li>
Show that L3 = {1<sup>n<sup>2</sup></sup> | n &ge; 0} is not regular. {"",1,1111,111111111, ...}

<li>

Show that L5 = {xx<sup>R</sup> y | x,y in (0+1)<sup>+</sup>} is not regular.

<li>
Show that L6 = {O<SUP>m</SUP>1<SUP>n</SUP>O<sup>m+n</sup> | m,n &ge; 0 } is not regular.
</ol>

Pumping Lemma alternates between "for all" and "there is at least one" or "for every" or
"there exists", Notice:

<ul>
<li>
For every regular language L
<li>
There exists a constant n
<li>
For every string w in L such that |w| &ge; n,
<li>
There exists a way to break up w into three strings w = xyz such that
<ol>
    <li> |y| &gt; 0
    <li> |xy| &le; n
    <li> For every k &ge; 0 , the string xy<SUP>k</SUP>z is also in L.
</ol>
</ul>
