This course is about learning to program and about applying our
knowledge of algorithm design in new and intertesting circumstances.
To do this we will study and solve many programming problems. Some of
the problems we will study have come from past ACM programming contests.
<p>
To be a good programmer one needs several skills -- to study problems
carefully, to weigh different approaches, and always to think before you write.
After taking this course students should be able to approach
solving programming contest problems in a calm and organized manner.

Below I will post announcements. I will post new announcements in front
of old ones, so the old ones will always still be there,  only further down the page.
