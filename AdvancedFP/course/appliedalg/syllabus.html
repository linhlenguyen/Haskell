<strong>Course Instructor</strong>
<br />Tim Sheard
<p>
<strong>Current Catalog Description</strong>
<br />Application of algorithms to solving a variety of problems. Factors influencing choice of algorithms for a given problem. Students will work in groups and individually to solve problems in and outside of class.</p>
<p>
<strong>Prerequisite by Topic</strong>
<br />CS 350, Algorithms and Analysis.</p>
<p>
<strong>Course Goals</strong>
<br />Know and have programmed a variety of algorithms Be able to choose an appropriate algorithm to solve a problem.</p>
<p>Upon the successful completion of this course students will be able to:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Solve at least half of typical programming contest problems within three hours, working in teams. Solve at least one fourth within six hours, working alone.</li>
<li>Apply a repertoire of algorithms and approaches to solving problems, in at least four distinct areas (such as combinatorics, computational geometry, cyphers, balanced tree structures).</li>
<li>Develop alternate approaches to solving a problem and evaluate them for speed, space consumption, and difficulty.</li>
<li>Find relevant information for solving a problem in standard references on algorithms and on the web.</li>
<li>Describe an algorithm both orally and in writing.</li>
<li>Do back-of-the-envelope calculations to estimate time for various algorithms that might be used to solve a problem.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Theoretical Content</strong>
<br />Algorithm analysis, problem abstraction, definition of invariants.</p>
<p>
<strong>Problem Analysis</strong>
<br />Students will analyze programming problems and puzzles, and devise approaches to solving them. The class will work on problems in groups and individually.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution Design</strong>
<br />Students will design and implement solutions to a variety of programming problems and puzzles. This will be done both in groups and individually, and with problems at a variety of challenge levels.</p>
