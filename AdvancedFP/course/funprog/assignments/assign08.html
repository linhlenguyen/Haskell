MUSIC
(Read chapter 20 to get started on these questions)

1) Use the Haskore library to compose a short 8 measure piece of music in
4/4 time. That means 4 beats per measure, 1 beat per quarter note. Your
music should have a duration of 32 quarter notes.

2) Make a round out of your music. A round is a piece of music that is
played multiple times, simultaneously, but each time delayed by two
measures. For example:

m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 m8
      m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 m8
            m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 m8
