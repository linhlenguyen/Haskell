1) HigherOrder functions:
   Exercise 5.9 page 73 of the text

   Suppose you are given a non-negative integer "amt" representing a sum
   of money, and a list of coin denominations "[v1, v2, ..., vn]", each
   being a positive integer.  Your job is to make change for "amt" using
   the coins in the coin supply.  Define a function "makeChange" to solve
   this problem.  For example, your function may behave like this:

       makeChange 99 [5, 1]  =>  [19, 4]

   where 99 in the amount and [5, 1] represents the types of coins (say,
   nickels and pennies in US currency) that we have.  The answer [19, 4]
   means that we can make the exact change with 19 5-unit coins and 4
   single-unit coins; this is the best (in terms of the total number of
   coins) possible pollution.

   To make things slightly easier, you may assume that the list
   representing the coin denominations is given in descending order, and
   that the single-unit coin is always one of the coin types.


2) Trees:
   Consider the data definition:

data Tree a
 = Zero
 | One a (Tree a)
 | Two a (Tree a) (Tree a)

   A) Write the fold function for it.
      (hint: it has four parameters, one constant, two functions, and one Tree)
   B) Use it to define a function that sums all the objects
      in a (Tree a) object.

3) Exercise 7.4  page 86 of the text
   (Tree versions of zip and zipWith)

4) Exercise 7.5  page 86 of the text
   (Expr's with variables and "let". )
