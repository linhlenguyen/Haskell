--- Stream Diagram example:

counter inp = out

        out = ifx inp Then (lift 0) Else next
        next = [0] `followedBy` map (+ 1) out

--- Client Server Example ------

type Response = Integer
type Request = Integer

client :: [Response] -> [Request]
client ys = 1 : ys

server :: [Request] -> [Response]
server xs = map (+1) xs

reqs = client resps
resps = server reqs

clientB (y : ys) = 
   if ok y 
      then 1 :(y:ys) 
      else error "faulty server"
   where ok x = True
   
clientC ys = 
   1 : (if ok (head ys) then ys else error "faulty server")
 where ok x = True

clientD ~(y:ys) = 
   1 : (if ok y then ys else error "faulty server")
 where ok x = True

---- Memoization ----

fibsFn :: () -> [ Integer ]

mfibsFn x = let mfibs = memo1 mfibsFn
            in 1:1:zipWith(+)(mfibs()) (tail (mfibs()))
