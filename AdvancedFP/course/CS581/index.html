        <LI> The use of Haskell
        <p>
        We will make considerable use of small Haskell programs to describe the mathematical objects
        we study in this course. One may think of these Haskell programs as type-checked psuedo-code.
        I will not ask students to write any Haskell code. The source of the Haskell code
        we study will be available for download, and students are welcome to explore this code
        if they desire.
