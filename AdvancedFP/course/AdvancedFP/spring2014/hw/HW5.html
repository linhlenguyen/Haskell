Create a single Haskell file that contains solutions to the following problems.
Be sure it compiles without errors, and submit it via D2L by class time on
May 8th, 2014.
<p>
Be sure you put your name and e-mail in a comment
at the beginning of the file</B>. Without this you will not get any feedback.

<p>

In this homework you will do two kinds of things.
<ul>
  <li> Write a few functions using the Arrow package to structure your code.
  <li> Write a few functions that consume or produce data (co-data) constructed
       using Algebras.
</ul>
<p>

Start with the file <A HREF="HW5Template.html">HW5Template.html</A>.
It has all the boiler plate you will need.

<p>
<ol>

<li> Write a function <B>strToInteger</B> with type <B>[Char] -> Integer</B> using arrows.
Use the following as a guide. Each step consists of a single Arrow, and all the steps
are glued together with arrow composition. Here is a visual representation of
the steps on a sample string "4385".

<PRE>
    "4385"::Int -->
    ([4,3,8,5],[0,1,2,3])::([Int],[Integer]) -->
    ([4,3,8,5],[0,1,2,3])::([Integer],[Integer])  -->
    ([5,8,3,4],[1,10,100,1000])::([Integer],[Integer]) -->
    [5,80,300,4000]::[Integer] -->
    4385::Integer
</PRE>
<p>
Hint: Comment out the type of <B>strToInteger</B> and write it one step at
a time. At each step test your code to see that it does what you expect. Then add
another step. Replace the type when your through to check that you have indeed
written a function with the right type.
<p>
Test your code.
<p>



<li> Write the function <B>printFileInc</B> with type <B>Kleisli IO FilePath ()</B> using arrows.
It reads a string of digits from a file, and prints to the terminal
the successor of the value of that string of digits as an Integer.
<p>
Test your code.
<p>



<li> Write the function <B>incFile</B> with type <B>FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()</B>  using arrows.
It reads a string of digits from a file, and prints
the successor of the value of that string of digits to another file.
<p>
Test your code.
<p>

<li> <STRONG>Functors</STRONG>. Define two functors <B>TreeF</B> and <B>LangF</B>. The functor <B>TreeF</B> will be used as an initial
algebra to represent binary search trees. Such trees have two types of nodes. Leaves
(we will call "<B>Tip</B>") that store no data, and internal nodes (we will call "<B>Fork</B>") that store an Int and two
sub trees. The functor <B>LangF</B> will be used as an initial algebra to represent the language
T5 of <A HREF="hw3.html">homework 3</A>. We reproduce the data definition used in that
homework here for reference.

<PRE>
data T5 = Add5 T5 T5
        | Sub5 T5 T5
        | Mult5 T5 T5
        | Int5 Int
        | Var5 String
        | Assign5 String  T5
</PRE>
<p>
Use the same constructor names in your function <B>LangF</B>, that are used in <B>T5</B> above.
<p>

<li> <STRONG>Initial Algebras</STRONG>. Use the functors defined above (TreeF and LangF) and those defined
in <A HREF="HW5Template.html">HW5Template.html</A> (F1, NatF, ListF, StreamF) to define several
values of the types listed below.

<ul>
<li> The natural number corresponding to 4, as an <B>(Initial NatF)</B>.
<li> The list corresponding to [3,7,1,6] as an <B>(Initial (ListF Int))</B>.
<li> A binary search tree (maintaining the search tree invariant) that stores
the values 7,2,45, and 11, as an <B>(Initial TreeF)</B>.
<li> The T5 program corresponding to  (y + (4 - (x := 8))) as an <B>(Initial LangF)</B>.
</ul>

<p>
<li> <STRONG>Consuming Initial Algebras</STRONG>.

<ul>
<li> Write a function <B>toInt</B>, written as a catamorphism over <B>(Initial NatF)</B> that produces an equivalent Int.
for example. <B>toInt (Init (S (Init Z))</B> --> <B>1</B>
<p>
<li> Make the types <B>(Initial (ListF Int))</B> and
<B>(Initial LangF)</B> instances of the Show class, by writing the show functions
as a catamorphism.
<p>
<li> Write the addition function over natural numbers as a function over <B>(Initial NatF)</B>
as a catamorphism. Your catamorphism should consume an algebra with type
<B>Algebra (NatF c -> c)</B>, where <B>c</B> = <B>(Initial NatF -> Initial NatF)</B>. That is the carrier is
a function, not a piece of data.
<p>
<li> Finally, redo the function <B>eval5a :: T5 -> Store Map Value</B> from <A HREF="hw3.html">homework 3</A> as a catamorphism.
Your function will have type <B>eval5a :: Iniitia LangF -> Store Map Value</B>.
You will probably have to cut and paste some helper functions into your solution file from your
homework 3 solution. You probably also want to make (Store m v) a monad instance.

</ul>
<p>
<li> <STRONG>Final Algebras</STRONG>. Create an infinite program <B>infExp</B> as a <B>Final LangF</B> that represents
the program (1 + (2 + (3 + (+ 4 ...)))).  Hint.  First write a function<B> f :: Int -> LangF (Final LangF)</B>,
and then apply it to <B>1</B> to build your value.

<p>
<li> <B>Finite Observation of a Final Algebra</B>. Write a function prefix with type
<B>Int -> Final LangF -> Initial LangF</B> that observes an infinite <B>Final LangF</B> structure to
a fixed depth.  For example <B>prefix 6 infExp</B> produces the expression
<B>(1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + (5 + (0 + 0))))))</B>.  Note that my function returns <B>(Init(Int5 0))</B> for all
infinite structures deeper than the prefix.
