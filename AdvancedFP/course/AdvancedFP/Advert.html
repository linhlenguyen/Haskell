This course is about advanced topics in functional programming. We will learn
advanced features of the Haskell programming language. Topics to
be covered will be partially decided by the interests of the class members.
<p>
A listing of some possble topics can be found by looking at the
<A HREF="2004/notes/index.html"> Lecture Notes</A>
from a similar class I taught in the past.
<p>
We will also read some papers describing some of these topics. Here
is a listing of some <A HREF="2004/papers/index.html"> Papers</A> we might read.
<p>
The class will be based on lecture notes, and on writing and reading Haskell programs.
A basic understanding of functional programming, as found in the class
<A HREF="../CS457-557/index.html">CS410/510</A> is assumed.
