allow you to put to work what you have learned about ethics, ethical reasoning, and
social responsibility. The product of the group collaboration
is a powerpoint presentation and an oral presentation. The oral
presentation will occur in the block of time reserved for the final
exam for our class: Thursday, March 19, 2009. 12:30 - 2:20 PM.

The topic for the project is ethical considerations of the "Octo-mom" case. The delivery of
octuplets to Nadya Suleman. Each group will research a different ethical principle, they will
then apply that principle to the facts of the "Octo-mom" case and make a set of recomendations
consistent with their ethical principle. The point of the presentation is to inform the class
of the important ideas relevant to the ethical principle of your group, the facts of the case,
and your recomendations for the future in an informative and entertaining manner.

Some guidlines for Presentation preparation.

<UL>
<LI> A presentation is a tool that helps you explain to others what you have done.
Most of the information is in your comments. The poster gives you something to refer to, and reminds you of important points.
<LI> A 10 minute presentation will have between 5 and 9 slides.
<LI>Keep visuals simple and uncluttered
<LI>Restrict text to 4-8 lines per page.
<LI>Use color and font changes to carry a message (e.g. related concepts or experimental results in the same colors), not arbitrarily.
<LI>Use LARGE fonts.
<LI>Use graphics rather than words where possible.
<LI>Put keywords on poster to help you remember script.
