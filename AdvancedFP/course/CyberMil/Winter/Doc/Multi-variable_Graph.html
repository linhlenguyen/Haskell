<title>Multi-variable graphing assignment</title><p><center><b>Graphing multiple variables in Excel Assignement</b></center>

<p>Your task is to make another Excel graph, but this time with two or more variables per item graphed.  If you already made a multi-variable graph for the last graphing assinment try something new this time -- like a scatter plot.  

<p>Like the last graphing assignment you will need to find data on the internet, or use your own, organize it in Excel, and create a chart using the chart wizard.  After creating the graph make sure it's labeled correctly, paste it in a Word document labeled with your name and a few sentances describing the graph's meaning and relevance.  The finished document is due in the main session, next Monday, March 9th.

<p>You may want to refer back to the <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/course/CyberMil/Doc/SourcesOfData.html">tour of data sources</a> we did last week for links to tabular data on the internet.

<p><b>Here are some examples of graphs using 2 or more variables:</b><br>

This collumn graph uses two series (French and German) for each x-axis value.<br>
