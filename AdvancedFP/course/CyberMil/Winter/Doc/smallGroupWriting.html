	Is the idea small enough (you only have a paragraph or two).
	what does paper 1 say about this idea
	what does paper 2 say about this idea
	What do I think about this idea
	do they agree, or disagree, or agree somewhat but have subtle differences
list examples to support from the papers
what other ideas from elsewhere might be useful
		write them down
what kind of argument will you make?
	One paper is more convincing
	Neither paper is convincing
	The idea has universal truth
	The reasoning in one or both of the papers is flawed (why?, what consequences does this have)
	One paper has bias because ...
	other choice of your own devising
