</CENTER>

<p>
This document tries to make explicit what each team must turn in to complete
the final project. In addition to the oral presentation (Due via
email to Professor Sheard by 5:00 pm, Wednesday, March 18.), each team must turn in a packet
with the following contents.
<p>

<ul>

<li> The packet is to be bound together with a cover and back sheet.
<li> The first page is a title sheet. It must contain the full name
of all team members, and a title which indicates which ethical principle
the presentation is based upon.
<li> The full powerpoint slide presentation must be included
in the bound packet. It should be <B>printed in color</B>, and each page should
be numbered.

<li> The bound packet must contain information regarding the workings of the team.
See the group activity <A HREF="GroupActivityLog.doc">log</A> for an example of
what you might turn in. At a minimum it should contain
	<ol> <li> A list containing the agenda and actions of each team meeting.
	     <li> A list of the roles played by each team member.
	     <li> A list of the tasks assigned to each team member.
	     <li> An assessment of of how the team worked together.
	</ol>
<li> The last page should be a copy of the oral presentation
<A HREF="OralPresentationRubric.html">Grade Sheet</A>. You should fill in the blanks
appropriate to your team. Professor Sheard will fill in the rest
of the worksheet when you give your presentaion.

<li> In addition, each team member must complete the survey on-line for
evaluating team constributions by the end of the day, Friday, March 20, 2009,
by 3:00 PM.  Any one who doesn't complete the survey will have their
grade on the project lowered by 30%.
