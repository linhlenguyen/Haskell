It is remarkable how the new period resembles the old in many
little ways: the early 19th century was a period of vulgar theater,
elephantine buildings, public obsession with murders and execu-
tions, increasing fear of street crime, great enthusiasm for boxing
and other violent spectator sports, and passions for running, bal-
looning, and gambling of all kinds, including lotteries. But it is
remarkable also that the large characteristics that served earlier to
define the first Industrial Revolution can be applied, though with
the same caution of erring toward the schematic and reductive, to
the second as well.

This time around the technology is even more complex and exten-
sive, and its impact even more pervasive and dislocating, touch-
ing greater populations with greater speed and at greater scales.
No one voted for this technology or any of the various machines
and processes that make it up; no one explained or even thought
much about what the consequences of any of them would be,
singly or synergistically, on individual, society, or environment;
and no one took responsibility for the transformations they have
wrought, except insofar as governments were ultimately asked to
care for the most ruinous results (poverty, pollution, unemploy-
ment). It "just happened," in an onrush of industrial creation,
swiftly and powerfully and inescapably. But the effects are pro-
found, maybe more profound than we know.

But the kind of technology shaping the second Industrial
Revolution has its own special and inescapable logic, just as the
one wrought by the steam engine had its, that goes beyond the
proliferation of its machines and methods. Automation, for
example, is an inevitable consequence of computerization and
robotics, and serves to replace human endeavor in more and
more ways in more and more settings. Simplification and rou-
tinization are similar consequences in tasks where humans are
still involved, deskilling and often dehumanizing the operatives
and making them subject to minute monitoring and discipline.

IN MARCH 1990, a New Mexico psychologist named Chellis
Glendinning published "Notes toward a Neo-Luddite manifesto,"
an attempt to give legitimacy to those who in one way or another
are troubled by, and resistant to, the technology of the second
Industrial Revolution, and to prepare the ground for a statement
that would articulate their critique and goals.

"Neo-Luddites have the courage to gaze at the full catastrophe
of our century," she began, which is that "the technologies cre-
ated and disseminated by modern Western societies are out of
control and desecrating the fragile fabric oflife on Earth." And to
underscore the link of present with past, she added, "Like the
early Luddites, we too are a desperate people seeking to protect
the livelihoods, communities, and families we love, which lie on
the verge of destruction."

What happens when an economy is not embedded in a due
regard for the natural world, understanding and coping with the
full range of its consequences to species and their ecosystems, is
not only that it wreaks its harm throughout the biosphere in
indiscriminate and ultimately unsustainable ways, though that is
bad enough. It also loses its sense of the human as a species and
the individual as an animal, needing certain basic physical ele-
ments for successful survival, including land and air, decent food
and shelter, intact communities and nurturing families.
<p>
At a certain point,
one that we have reached in the 2oth century, technology can
completely overwhelm so many other elements of that world as
to threaten its continued existence, and unless the technosphere
re-establishes some connectedness to the biosphere it seems likely
to carry out that threat.
