Please pick a slot for me to meet with you one on one to talk
about your rough draft. I hope to make this a low-stakes
meeting where I give an honest opinion about your draft and
some advice about how to improve it. There is no grade
or consequence attached to the meeting. Please sign up for a slot
only if you can attend.

<p>
Choose one of the times below. Please note that all
meetings are in my office in the Computer Science Building, in the
Fourth Ave Building, FAB 120-04. See here for a <A HREF="../DirecToMyOffice.html">map</A> and directions.

<p>
The reasons for these meeting include:

<OL>

<LI> I want to give you some individual feedback on your writing.

<LI> I want to hear what you think about your own writing skills.

<LI> I want students to practice reading their own work aloud
as an exercise in improving their writing.

<LI>I want to find out from each student what they need
to become better writers.

</OL>
