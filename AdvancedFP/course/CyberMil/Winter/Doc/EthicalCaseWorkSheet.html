<ul>
<li> Recognize the ethical issues

<li> Could this decision or situation be damaging to someone or to some group? Does this decision involve a choice between a good and bad alternative, or perhaps between two "goods" or between two "bads"? <br> <br> <br>

</ol>

<li> Get the facts
<ul>
<li>Summarize the facts of the case.<br> <br> <br>
<p>

<li>  <br> <br>
<li>   <br> <br>
<li>   <br> <br>
</ol>

<p> Have all the relevant persons and groups been consulted?
<p> Have I identified creative options?
<p> Are there win-win solutions? Identify which ones.  <br> <br> <br>

<li> Evaluate alternative actions by asking the following questions:
<ol>
<li>Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm? (The Utilitarian Approach) Why?  <br> <br> <br>
<li> Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake? (The Rights Approach) Why?  <br> <br> <br>
<li> Which option treats people equally or proportionately? (The Justice Approach) Why?  <br> <br> <br>
<li> Which option best serves the community  as a whole, not just some members? (The Common Good Approach) Why?  <br> <br> <br>
<li> Which option leads me to act as the sort of person I want to be? (The Virtue Approach) Why?  <br> <br> <br>
</ol>
<p>
<li> Make a decsion and test it.
<p>
Considering all these approaches, which option best addresses the situation? Tell me
what option you choose and why.  <br> <br> <br>  <br> <br> <br>

<li> Act and reflect on the outcome
<p>
How can my decision be implemented with the greatest care and attention to the concerns of all stakeholders?  <br> <br> <br>

<p> How did my decision turn out and what have I learned from this specific situation?
Speculate on things that might go wrong.  <br> <br> <br>
