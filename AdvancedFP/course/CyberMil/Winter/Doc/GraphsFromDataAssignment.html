<BIG> Making Graphs from Data Assignment </BIG>
</CENTER>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to gather some data from the web. Create
an Excel spreadsheet, and create a graph that displays your data in the most
advantageous way. Your data should graph some value across one or more dimensions.
<p>
Possible dimensions include time (I.e. every year for many years), geography
(economic data across many different states), etc. Your dimension must have
at least 5 elements. More than 5 is better.

<p>

First you should review the <A HREF="SourcesOfData.html">tour of data on the web</A> to refresh your self
of the many kinds of data available. You are not limited to data on the tour.
You may find your own data.
