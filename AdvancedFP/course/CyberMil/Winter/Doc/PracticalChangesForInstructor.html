<p>
Suggest one or two practical changes your instructor can make to improve your learning in
this course.

<p><UL>

<LI> Listen to students; Try to make class interesting

<LI> Don't be so monotone..

<LI>Give helpful commentary on papers. Use activities and class discussion to engage students. not
show bias in opinion on topics or belittle other students for their opinions.

<LI>He could relate more to the Cyborg Millennium theme, and he could also provide more of a
purpose to technology.

<LI>It is hard to improve on one's writing skills when writing assignments are short and few

<LI> One, stop calling it "Cyber" Millenium, and start calling it "Cyborg" Millenium.&CR;&LF;Two,
show how the current course work is related to to the subject of the class.

<LI>More interesting and related topics.

<LI>The assignments need to be explained a lot more and they need to contain less restrictions.
Assignments are too uninteresting and restricting that they are discouraging to do.

<LI>make instructions of assignments clearer

<LI>Try to be more clear with the class in discussions and not ramble on infinitely.

<LI>Make the class more active, like maybe more group projects

<LI>Try to be more engaging to pull in the class and get their attention.&CR;&LF;

<LI>to pesent course matirial in aa way that is clear and understandable

<LI>Change the lectures to make it more interesting. The lectures do not lead to a specific point.
They basically become more complicated and confusing. Making me look dumb. But maybe that
is just me.

<LI>Keep the class on topic, don't assign us work that has little to nothing to do with the subject of
the class. Make things easy to say, "oh that assignment is about this which relates to our class in
this particular way". You don't want to learn about the American Civil War when you are taking
a class on ancient roman Philosophy. ...just as an example.

<LI>Less lecturing and more activities

<LI>again more focoused.

<LI>Shows more engagement in class activities and helps gives the information in an interesting and
exciting manner.

<LI>He can be specific on exactly what he wants such as a works cited on our term paper.

<LI>Work with the mentor more. Also, I think he could make himself more clear on what he wants
for each assignment.
