</CENTER>

<p>

<b>Goals </b><br><ul>
<li>Develop a search strategy<br>
<li>Organize the results of your search<br>
<li>Find material for your annotated bibliography<br>
<li>Connect your ideas with scientific evidence to use in your paper<br>
<li>Connect ethical issues with scientific evidence</ul>

<p>

<b><center>Strategy for collecting resources for research papers</center></b>
<li>Create folder on the H: drive to store all materials related to the project.
<li>Create a word document to list all of the sources you find and save it in your new folder.  This can become your annotated bibliography.  

<ul><b>Each entry in the document should include:</b>

<li>  The name of the resource
<li>  A quick note that reminds you of it's relevance to your research question
<li>  The URL</ul>

You can also paste any relevant quotes from the source here.  This will come in handy when you start composing your paper.<br>

<b><center>Demonstration of methods for starting a search </b> <br>

<i>While these are not valid sources for an academic paper, they can lead to other, more scholarly sources.</i></center><br>


<li>Google or another search engine<br>
	<ul>Google: "genetic patent" <br>
		<ul>view article "Genetics and patenting" on ornl.gov</ul></ul>
<li>Wikipedia <br>
	<ul> view Wiki article "Gene patent"<br>
	look at references and external links<br>
		<ul>follow link for the Science article -- if this were my topic I would save it my research folder<br>
		at the bottom of this article note the references and outside citations<br>
		follow the link to "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: Patents on Human Genes: An Analysis of Scope and Claims"
			<ul> DEAD END </UL>
		Try the <ahref= "">PSU Library electronic journals for the article<br>

</ul></ul><br>
