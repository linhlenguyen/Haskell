<LI>Writing Skills

<LI>Listening to the various lectures and thinking about the subjects that they talked about were
most helpful to me in the main section of the class. Thinking about the difference between

<LI>Being able to talk with Professor Sheard out of class.

<LI>Regular writing assignments allowed me to practice my writing.

<LI>Power point presentations.

<LI>Jason Michael White, our mentor helped me to understand everything that was confusing

<LI>The most helpful in this class is being able to have a peer mentor that understands our point of
view in a class. Having the Daily Record to check assignments is also helpful.

<LI>The most helpful part is when we have a question or when we need help, someone is there to
help us

<LI>This class focus's on different and new ideas that normally i wouldn't think about, studying in
this class forces one to think abstractly and be open to the improbable

<LI>In this class, the most helpful thing was probably the Daily Record. It helped me to stay on top
of what was due in class.

project which helped me communicate in a group

<LI>Most helpful section of the class is when the teacher assigns class activities and discuss with it.

<LI>Class discussions, group assignments, and reading books that clearly connect with the subject of
the class.

<LI>Learning how to work in groups.

<LI>The debate. was the best part.
