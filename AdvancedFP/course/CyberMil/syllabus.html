<H1>Course Description </H1>

This year-long course is organized and designed to facilitate an analysis of
the ways in which the ever-increasing influence of technology is
transforming human experience.  We will do this by studying computers
and their interaction with humans. We will first study
the notion of computation (the process by which machines
manipulate information) and the interface between man and machines.
We will study what it means to be intelligent. Can machines be inteliigent?
Can machines learn? Can they acquire new abilities by
observing other's behavior? Can machines be human-like?
<p>
In popular culture, the image of the cyborg lies at the heart of
this interface between man and machine.  We will study
how popular culture has portrayed the cyborg, and compare
this with our prior study of the nature of intelligence.
<p>
We will then turn our focus to the effects the digital world
has on the modern civilization. How it affects the media, the
financial system, communications, transportation, the educational
system, the world of art and design, the hard sciences, and
our every day lives.
<p>
Once we understand the ubiquity of these effects, we will
investigate can (or should) we try and influence them? What
ethical limits should society try and place on them? We will
identify current ethical issues such as privacy, digital rights
management, and the advisability of electronic-voting. We will
study the legal and societal means we may use to influence
these effects.
<p>
In the winter we will study the ways in which the emerging technologies of
genetic engineering, cloning, and other new scientific technologies are
transforming our concepts of humanity, society, freedom, privacy and
cultural identity. We will be examining the changes that are taking place in
social relations, legal doctrines, and political beliefs. We will consider
the dangers, opportunities and ethical ambiguities inherent in these new
technologies. In the spring we will examine the relationship between human
communities and technologies addressing issues such as the digital divide,
technological haves and have nots, and international issues surrounding
ddigital technologies.
<p>
In the Spring we will discover the beauty, trials, and tribulations of how we can
prograsm a computer ourselves in a 4 week project where will learn to write simple
programs in the Haskell programming language. We will also investigate how
the rapid changes in technology may change the world we live in. One excellent
resource we will use in this investigation is the book <A HREF="http://singularity.com/">The Singularity is Near</A>
by Ray Kurzweil.
<p>
Through reading fiction, viewing films and television programs, reading case
studies, and doing field research we will explore the many complex faces
of technology.
<p>
Drawing on writing, speaking, artwork, books, media and original projects
you will have a wide range of outlets through which to experience and
articulate your own questions and ideas, as well as those of others, as we
examine the changing role of technology in our lives.

<H1>Things needed</H1>

<UL> <LI> <B>PSU Odin account</B> and registration in the course.  These will give
  you WebCT access, which is also required.  If you don’t have an account

</UL>



<H1>Mentor Sessions</H1>

Mentor sessions are an integral part of the course and provide an array of
learning experiences that will enable you to succeed in this course.
Attendance and participation will be part of your grade.


<H1>Spring Term E-Portfolio</H1>

At the end of the Spring term you will submit a portfolio showing your work and
demonstrating your progress against University Studies Goals.  The final end
of the year portfolio must be a web page and will be cumulative.  So save
ALL your work both electronically and in hard copy at least until the end of
the year.  The fall portfolio may be waived, however you would still need to
do the final essay and need to save your fall work for the winter and spring
portfolios. See <A HREF="http://sites.google.com/a/pdx.edu/the-eportfolio-way">FRINQ ePortfolio Guide</A>
for some more details.

<H1>University Studies Goals</H1>

Inquiry based student learning is the cornerstone of the University Studies’
Freshman Inquiry courses.  The goals are to develop those skills that will
be crucial to your academic success and beyond.  The four major learning
goals of University Studies are:

<UL>
 <LI> <B>Inquiry and Critical Thinking</B> <br>
      Students will learn various modes of inquiry through interdisciplinary
      curricula—problem-posing, investigating, conceptualizing—in order to
      become active, self-motivated, and empowered learners.

 <LI> <B>Communication</B> <br>
      Students will enhance their capacity to communicate in various
      ways -- writing, graphics, numeracy, and other visual and oral means—to
      collaborate effectively with others in group work, and to be competent
      in appropriate communication technologies.


 <LI> <B>The Variety of Human Experience</B> <br>
      Students will enhance their appreciation for and understanding of the
      rich complexity of the human experience through the study of
      differences in ethnic and cultural perspectives, class, race, gender,
      sexual orientation, and ability.


 <LI> <B>Ethical Issues and Social Responsibility</B> <br>
      Students will expand their understanding of the impact and value of
      individuals and their choices on society, both intellectually and
      socially, through group projects and collaboration in learning
      communities.
</UL>

The goals themselves, as well as grading rubrics used by instructors
to evaluate if students have met these goals can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.pdx.edu/unst/goals.html">http://www.pdx.edu/unst/goals.html</A>


<H1>Grading and Assignments </H1>

Spring term we will be doing a 4-week project on learning to program.
This will include many small programming tasks and a programming project.
The project will be done in pairs, and will be based upon
each teams interests, but must illustrate the mantra -
(1) Acquire data. (2) Manipluate data. (3) Visulaize data.
<p>
There will also be a term paper that will incorporate numeric data
and the graphic visualization of data. Most likely the topic
of the paper will be drawn from our study of <A HREF="http://singularity.com/">The Singularity is Near</A>.
<p>
We’ll also have several short (1-2 page)
writing assignments, and worksheets and quizes based upon the readings.
<p>
Course grade will be based
roughly on the following, however changes to assignments may change this
somewhat.

<UL>
  <LI> 35%  Class participation, including
    <OL>
           <LI> Attendance (8%)
           <LI> Reading Comprehension Activities (quizzes, work-sheets, etc) (10%)
           <LI> Class Preparation activities (reading notes, 1st drafts, products for peer review, etc) (10%)
           <LI> Class Participation in Discussion and in Mentor Sessions (7%)
    </OL>

  <LI> 65% Assignments and Projects including, but not limited to:
  <OL>  <LI> Short Writing Assignments (10%)
        <LI> Term Paper (20%)
        <LI> Programming Project (20%)
        <LI> E-Portfolio (15%)


</UL>

Please save your work throughout the year. You will need it for the
preparing a cumulative portfolio each quarter.  Your Mentor records
your mentor session participation and attendance and has direct
input in your grade. Final grade is assigned by the instructor.
<p>

Work not turned in, unacceptable work or an absence from class when
the work was done receives no credit. In addition if more than five
classes (main and/or mentor) are missed the quarter grade will be
reduced by one full letter grade.  You will be marked absent for the
day if you miss more than ten minutes of class. You will receive a
failing grade if you miss a total of 10 instructor lead classes or
mentor sessions or a combination thereof, despite your grades on
work completed.
<p>

Readiness to learn means that you will come to class with questions
and insights to offer to others and be prepared to discuss the
assigned reading.  We will be learning from each other and your
voice is important.  Your participation grade will include
attendance, participation in class discussions, participation in
online discussions, and group work in class on smaller design
problems and case studies.
<p>
