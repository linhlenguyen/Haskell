<p>
When you turn in a programming assignment there are three
things I need.

<ul>
<li> A copy of the program on paper, so that I can mark it up, and return to you.
<li> A copy of the output, so that I can see that it works correctly
<li> An actual copy of the program so I can run it.
</ul>
<p>
Here is how I want you to proceed.
<ul>
<li> <B>The paper copy</B>.  Print it out and bring it to class.
<li> <B>The output</B>.
   <ol>
     <li> Run the program in a freshly opened winhugs.
     <li> Run your program on enough inputs to demonstrate that it works.
     <li> Use the clip board to copy the complete buffer
     <li> Paste the buffer into a blank Notepad editor file.
     <li> Print the file and hand the copy of the output to me in class
     along with the copy of the program.
     <li> Write your name on both parts and staple them together
     </ol>
<li> <B>The actual program</B>.
    <ol>
      <li> Email me the program as an attachment
      <li> The body of the email should include who the programmers are.
      <li> Be sure your name(s) are in the program as comments as well.
      <li> The name of the attachment should include the name of the assignment
      as well as the programmers name
      <li> For example "calendarTomRyan.hs"
    </ol>
</ul>
