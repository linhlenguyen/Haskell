I am Husband, Father, Brother, Son. <BR>
I am Teacher, Mathematician, Scholar. <BR>
I am my Father's son, 12 years after his death. <BR>
I am my mother's caregiver, even when she doesn't remember my name. <BR>
I am one of 42 first cousins. <BR>
I am the peacemaker in my extended family. <BR>
I am dog-walker, pilot, swimmer. <BR>
I am sometimes lonely, sometimes too busy, sometimes overwhelmed. <BR>
