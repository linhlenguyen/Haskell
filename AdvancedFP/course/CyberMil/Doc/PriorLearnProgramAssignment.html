<BIG> Programming project #1. Prior Learning Survey Data </BIG>
</CENTER>
<p>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<p>
This is the first programming project. It involves (1) writing a Haskell program
that manipulates the prior learn survey data. (2) Creating suitable Excel
table from your results. (3) Graphing the  data inside Excel. (4) Writing
a 1 page report that includes the program and the graph.

<p>
<H3>Examples</H3>
<p>
I have created several example programs, graphs, and write ups so
that you can see an example of what is required.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Gender vs major. <A HREF="../Code/DemoMajors.hs">program</A>, <A HREF="../Code/TableMajors.xls">excel</A>, <A HREF="WordMajors.doc">word</A>.
<li> Parental college experience vs Student expectations of graduation. <A HREF="../Code/DemoParentEdLevel.hs">program</A>, <A HREF="../Code/TableParentEdLevel.xls">excel</A>, word.
<li> Major vs self rating of quantitative and social abilities. <A HREF="../Code/DemoSelfRating.hs">program</A>, <A HREF="../Code/TableSelfRating.xls">excel</A>, word.
</ul>
You should study these examples. What kind of functions
did I write? Could you think of any variations that might be usefull
in your own program? You are welcome to use or modify any
of the functions I wrote to do these examples.
<p>
<H3>Getting Started</H3>
I have created a small program stub that you can fill in as a means to get started, and
created some other documents and resources. Follow the list of directions:

<ul>
<li> Down load the prior leaning <A HREF="../Code/priorLearningStub.hs">stub</A> program to get started.
<li> Be sure you have downloaded the newest versions of <A HREF="../Code/Excell.hs">Excell.hs</A> and the <A HREF="../Code/CSV.hs">CSV.hs</A> libraries into the same directory.
     (Download them and just overwrite the old versions).
<li> You will also need to download the <A HREF="../Code/PriorLearn.hs">PriorLearn.hs</A> library
<li> Read through the prior learning <A HREF="../Code/PriorLearningSurveyFieldKey.docx">key</A> to get some idea what kind of data is available.
<li> Each question in the key is numbered. Right down the numbers of the questions that you
     want to use for data in your program. E.g. question 41 is students major.
<li> Start up Hugs on your program. Inside hugs type "name 41". This returns the name of the
     Haskell function that will access the data for question 41 "major41". Thus you
     could type "major41 (priorLearnData !! 22)" to get the major of the 22 student in the prior learning data.
     See the <A HREF="../Image/PriorLearnScreen1.jpg">screen shot</A> for an example.
<li> Study the example programs to see how to use these functions to select just the data you want.

<li> Now edit the <A HREF="../Code/priorLearningStub.hs">stub</A> to create some data that answers a question
of your interest.
<li> Work by creating a series of temporary values. Look at each temporary value and decide
     how to create the next one. You might study the examples I posted.
<li> Finally use the data to create an Excell table.
<li> From inside Hugs type "main". This will export the table to a file "myfileName.csv" which can
     be opened with Excel.
<li> Use Excel to create a graph or table.  Review the
     <A HREF="../Winter/Doc/Multi-variable_Graph.html">multi variable</A> graphing assignment from last term.
<li> Create a new word document.
      <ol> <li> Cut and paste the graph into the word document.
           <li> Also add some text describing what the graph represents.
           <li> Finally cut and paste the code into the word document
      </ol>
<li> Be sure the names of both people in the team appear on the very first line of
     the word document.
<li> See the section below for how to turn in your result.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>Grading Rubric</H3>
<p>
I will grade the project using the following criteria.
<ul>
<li> The result has the structure described above with names, graphs, caption, and program.
<li> The question you answer is original. You will get less credit for a question that more
than one team answers.
<li> The program adds something additional not found any of the examples.
<li> The graph is labeled and easy to read and understand.
<li> The caption describes the interesting results, as well as meaningful
information not found in the graph itself.
<li> The result is interesting, the write is aesthetically pleasing, the graph uses color,
     the program is simple and effective.
</ul>

<p>
<H3>What to turn in</H3>
<p>
Turn in the following things to complete the project. Be sure both team members names
are on all documents.
<ul>
<li> A copy of the program file you wrote.
<li> A few short tests that demonstrate that the table is built correctly.
<li> A copy of the Excel spreadsheet, which includes the graph you produced.
<li> A copy of the word document, that includes the graph, your writeup, and the propgram.
</ul>
