<p>
This combination worksheet and mentor session activity is to
help everyone get started with the Prior Learning Data.

<p>
<H3>What are the prior learning survey questions?</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The prior learning survey can be found <A HREF="../Code/PriorLearningSurveyFieldKey.docx">here</A>.

<li> You should open this file and peruse it. Think about what questions
are interesting to you.
<li> Write down the question numbers that you want to access. Write down
the way the answers are recorded. In all cases except major, the answer is
a small integer. For example question 110 is gender, the answers
will be either 1=male or 2=female, other answers are possible (usually 99=other and 101=left it blank). For each question of interest make a record of what
legitimate answers could be.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>What to download</H3>
Down load each of the following into your code directory on your H drive or
on your lap top.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Down load the prior leaning <A HREF="../Code/priorLearningStub.hs">stub</A> program to get started.
<li> Be sure you have downloaded the newest versions of <A HREF="../Code/Excell.hs">Excell.hs</A> and the <A HREF="../Code/CSV.hs">CSV.hs</A> libraries into the same directory.
     (Download them and just overwrite the old versions).
<li> You will also need to download the <A HREF="../Code/PriorLearn.hs">PriorLearn.hs</A> library
</ul>

<p>
<H3>Getting started in Hugs</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Open the <A HREF="../Code/priorLearningStub.hs">stub</A> program in your editor.
<li> Load the <A HREF="../Code/priorLearningStub.hs">stub</A> program into Hugs.
<li> It should look like <A HREF="../Image/AfterLoadingStub.jpg">this</A>
</ul>
<p>
<H3>Proccessing Prior Learning Data in Hugs</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The prior learning data is stored in a named declaration in the <A HREF="../Code/PriorLearn.hs">PriorLearn.hs</A>
library named <B>priorLearnData</B>.
<li> Look at the first two elements of the list by typing:  <B>take 2 priorLearnData</B>.
<li> It should look like <A HREF="../Image/FirstTwo.jpg">this</A>.
<li> Run an experiment. Use then <B>length</B> function to find out how many people
took the survey.
<li> In general we will access data by using comprehensions. Get the gender of all
students by typing:<br>  <B>[ gender110 x | x &lt;- priorLearnData ] </B>.
<li> There are lots of answers. So many that the results run off the screen.
Here is part of what <A HREF="../Image/MyScreen.jpg">appears on my screen</A>.
</ul>

<p>
<H3>Finding question labels</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Data is accessed by using selector functions like <B>gender110</B>. Each slector
function selects the answer from one question.
<li> There are over 120 different selector functions. You can find the name of
a selector function by using the <B>name</B> function in Hugs when the <A HREF="../Code/PriorLearn.hs">PriorLearn.hs</A> library
is loaded.
<li> Try it out, choose a question number, say 23, and type <B>name 23</B>.
<li> I ran a few examples, see my <A HREF="../Image/SeveralNameResults.jpg">results</A>.
<li> You can get all answers to question 23 by typing <B>[ psu_FriendsAttend23 x | x &lt;- priorLearnData ]</B>.
<li> Mostly we want only selected answers. We use the selection feature of comprehensions
to do this. For example I may write

<PRE>
[ age109 x | x <- priorLearnData
           , frinqRegThemeInterest32 x == 1
           , workHoursThisYear43 x == 4 ]
</PRE>

For the ages of all survey participants whose theme interest corresponds to
answer 1, and whose work hour corresponds to answer 4. How do I know what
values the answer coorespond to. Look them up in the <A HREF="../Code/PriorLearningSurveyFieldKey.docx">prior leanring document</A>!


</ul>
<p>
<H3>Writing a program in the stub file</H3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> I have started to write a <A HREF="../Code/Wk08PriorLearn.hs">program</A> in a stub file. Down load it
and load it into Hugs.
<li> What questions does this program deal with?
<li> What are the possible legal answers for each of the selector functions?
<li> Load it into hugs, and explore. What value does temp1 have?
<li> type temp2, what do you get? How can you interpret this data?
<li> <B>temp3</B> illustrates a very important function <B>mapGroup</B>.
<li> <B>mapGroup id</B> when applied to a list of pairs, and groups all elements together
with the same first pair. Each group has the common first element, and a list of all the second elements.
Try it by inspecting <B>temp3</B>.
<li> Now try inspecting <B>temp4</B>, which is similar to <B>temp3</B>, except
it uses length on all the second elements. How can we interpret <B>temp4</B>?
<li> What is <B>temp5</B>?
<li> Can you use the function <B>highschool</B> to get an interesting answer?
<li> Can you write your own function to use with <B>mapgroup</B>?


<li>
</ul>
