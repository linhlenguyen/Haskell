<p>


This exercise involves more internalizing the simplicity of thesis formulation, less
bothering yourself so early with the intricacies of the drafting process. As you
work through the assignment, remember to take it easy, you've likely too much else on
your plates to stress yourselves over this one-page assignment.
<p>

First, you'll need to isolate a question. "Why is the sky blue," isn't sufficient,
though neither would something overly complex fit the purposes of this exercise.
Really, try to formulate a fun question, something you'd get a kick out of briefly
researching.
<p>


Once you have your question, translate it into a statement. For example, if we were
to take, "Why is the sky blue," and turn it into a statement, it might sound
something like, "The sky is blue because".  Essentially, the goal here is to form a
thesis, that grounding statement from which so many works evolve and refer back to.
Understand, of course, that the formation of a thesis is, in most major ways, a
direct route to brainstorming the body of one's research, essays, or even simply
this assignment.
<p>


Next, take the statement you've created and figure out what could support it. Why
would the sky appear blue" The answer, or answers, to your question "what is also
your inevitable thesis statement" will birth the rough points, or body, of your
essay.
<p>


The format of your one-page essay should look like this:
<p>

<ul>
<li> Introductory paragraph
  <ol>
  <li> Thesis statement (it doesn"t necessarily have to appear at
		   the start, middle, or end of your introduction;
		   remember to have fun with this)
 </ol>

<li> A rough indication of what you"ll discuss in the body (making sure,
	   of course, that what you discuss is logical and relative to
	   your thesis statement).
	 <ol>
	  <li> Body paragraph(s)
	  <li>The proof, support, or arguing points that will add
		   legitimacy to your thesis statement </ol>
<li> Conclusion
		<ol>
		 <li> A rerounding of your assertion (now that the reader
		   has come this far, how might you wow them with less
		   boring, repetitive gobbledygook") </ol>
</ul>
<p>
This assignment's formatting: single-spaced, with one-inch margins and 12-point
type.
<p>
Bring three additional printouts of the assignment, and prepare to engage in a
workshop of your piece!
