Two good descriptions of how a debate works can be found on the web
The <A HREF="http://facstaff.bloomu.edu/jtomlins/debate_formats.htm">first</A> by
James Tomlinson describes the format of the classic Lincoln-Douglas debates.
The <A HREF="http://www.educationworld.com/a_lesson/03/lp304-01.shtml">second</A>
prepared by <I>Education World</I> gives some strategies for debaters to use
to increase their persuasiveness.
<p>
Because the time we have is limited to 24 minutes per debate, we will
use the following format adapted from the Education World site.

<UL>
<LI> Teams will be composed of approximately 5 students.
<LI> The format will be
<OL>
<LI> (5 minutes) Affirmative position debater presents constructive debate points.
<LI> (2 minutes) Negative position debater cross-examines affirmative points.
<LI> (5 minutes) Negative position presents constructive debate points.
<LI> (2 minutes) Affirmative position cross-examines negative points.
<LI> (3 minutes) Affirmative position offers first rebuttal
<LI> (5 minutes) Negative position offers first rebuttal
<LI> (2 minutes) Affirmative position offers second rebuttal
<LI> (24 minutes) total
</OL>
<LI> Note that one team (the Affirmative) gets to talk 4 times, and the other (The Negative)
gets to talk 3 times. Each team gets equal amount of time. A different team member
will talk each time.
<LI> Jason will be the moderator.
<LI> Tim will be the judge.
</UL>

<p>
It is best if each team studies the different startegies on the Education World
page, and chooses 1 or two as their debate preparation strategy.
