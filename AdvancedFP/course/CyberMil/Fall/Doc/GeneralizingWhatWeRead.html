The point of this assignment is to practice the skills of organizing our
independant learning activities. It is not enough to just read
a few articles. One must organize what one discovers. To help you do this,
as you read, do the following:

<ol>
<li> Look for patterns, things that arise over and over.
<li> Organize what you learn into its basic parts.
<Li> Try and recognize hidden meanings .
<Li> Identify components of things you alread know.
</ol>

Here are some keywords you might want to use
as you read: analyze, arrange, assay, audit, check, classify, compare, connect,
disassemble, dissect, divide, explain, include, infer, inspect, order, reason, screen, scrutinize,
section, select, simplify, survey, test, uncover.

The Goal is to synthesize a bigger picture than that covered by any one
document. Learning is all about creating this bigger picture in
your mind, so you can see connections, and opposing ideas in detail.
