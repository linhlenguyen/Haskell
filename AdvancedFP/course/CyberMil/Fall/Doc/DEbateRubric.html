This sheet describes how the the Team Debates will be assessed.
According to the class <A HREF="GroupGradingPolicy.html">group grading policy</A>,
A group project grade will have 3 components.
<p>
<ol>
<LI> Self Assessment       10%.  See the <A HREF="DebateEvaluation.html">Self and Peer Debate</A> record sheet.
<LI> Peer Assessment       30%.  See the <A HREF="DebateEvaluation.html">Self and Peer Debate</A> record sheet.

I will use the following items to come up with a grade.
<p>

<UL>

<p>Time and points for each part of the debate are listed.
<OL>

The strength of argument, appropriateness of the argument for each component, the presentation,
and the the ability to communicate clearly, ability to be heard and understood, will all be considered.
I will use the <A HREF="DebateRecordSheet.html">debate record sheet</A> to record this information during the debate.


<p>
<LI> Team Documents
<p>
Neatness,
completeness, and presentation will be part of the grade.
<p>
<ol>
<LI> Activity log of meetings, activities, attendance, and other pertinent material
<LI> Task Assignment Document, including a list of each task, its assigned owner,
an explicit set of expectations for that task, and date due.
</ol>
<p>
<LI> Individual Self Assessment
<p>
Part of an individuals grade will be based on the
<A HREF="DebateEvaluation.html">Self and Peer Debate</A> record sheet turned in.
This will be based upon the completness of the form, and the self
assessment essay.

<LI> Individual Peer Assessment
<p>
Information from all teammates' <A HREF="DebateEvaluation.html">Self and Peer Debate</A>
