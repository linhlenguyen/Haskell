<BIG>Group Work Grading Policy</BIG>
</CENTER>

<p>
In order to make grading group projects fair and transparent, we
have developed this group work grading policy. We will use
this policy for the first group project, and review it after
grades have been assigned.
<p>
A group project grade will have 3 components.
<p>
<ol>
<LI> Self Assessment       10%
<LI> Peer Assessment       30%
<LI> Instructor Assessment 60%
</ol>
<p>
In order to enable group assessment, each group will
create and maintain a number of documents.
<ol>
<LI> Activity log of meetings, activities, attendance, and other pertinent material
<LI> Task Assignment Document, including a list of each task, its assigned owner,
an explicit set of expectations for that task, and date due.
<LI> Project product.
</ol>
<p>
Both self assessment and peer assessment will include numeric
grades in the following areas, on a scale from 1 to 10.

<ol>
<LI> Performance against task
<LI> Communication skills
<LI> Leadership, constructive criticism
<LI> Work at attaining group adhesiveness (Cheerleading)
<LI> Participation in group meetings
<LI> Final assembly
</ol>

<p>
<H2>Self Assessment</H2>
<p>
In addition to the numeric grades, self assessment will include a short essay,
of approximately 250-500 words. This essay should provide insight into what the student feels
were his major accomplishments in the group.
It should also address areas where improvement may be needed
and a strategy for improving performance in that area in the next
group project.
<p>

<H2>Peer Assessment</H2>
<p>
Each group member will assign numeric grades to other group members.
There will be an opportunity for written review as well.

<p>
<H2>Instructor Assessment</H2>
<p>

The instructor will assign a grade to the group as a whole. This grade will based upon the
project product submitted, the presentation of the project to the class, the completed
activity log, and the completed task assignment document, as well as the completeness
of the self and peer assessment documents.
