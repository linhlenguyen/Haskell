<p>
The goal of this activity is critically review the one-page
election computer essay.
<p>
<ul>
<LI> Work in pairs, so find a partner.
<LI> First read out loud one of the essays. The author of the essay
should read it out loud, and the coach should follow along and stop the reader
whenever she feels the paper could be improved at that point.
<li> The author should make written comments on the paper indicating the
need and method of improvement.
<LI> Improvements could include: spelling, grammar, word choice, structure, things not understood, the need for
emphasizing the more important elements, etc.
<li> After the first paper is completed (about 15 minutes) switch roles.
<li> It is important to view this exercise as a means to improve the paper. Constructive comments are
best. What works?; where do things get difficult?; how can the argument be improved?; etc.
<li> When both papers have been read, make a list on the back of the paper
of the things you felt were most valuable to you in finding ways to improve your essay.
<li> Finally hand in the marked up essay to Jason. <STRONG>Be sure your name is on it.</STRONG>
