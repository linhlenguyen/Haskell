<p>
This is the Mini-Portfolio assignment.
At the end of every term Freshman Inquiry courses ask students to
reflect on their own learning process and on their progress toward
the four University Studies Goals.
<p>

This term (fall) you will complete a <B>mini</B> on-line portfolio as a
webpage on which you will post an essay addressing your progress
toward these goals as well as links to samples of your work.
Please note that linking to copies your work is not enough: you
must make an argument about why this piece of work represents your
progress toward the goal. This will be true about the larger
Spring term portfolio as well.

Your portfolio should have the following parts.
