<BIG>Goup Activity - 100 Word Essays</BIG>
</CENTER>

<p>
In class, on Oct 13, 2008. I gave the following small <A HREF="Chapt1&2GroupProj.html">group exercise</A>.
<p>
In each group, write a 100-250 word essay about the "Do Androids ..." world.
The goal is to speculate about concrete details that are only hinted
at in the first two chapters. Nothing is too bizarre, as long as you can
point to evidence in the first two chapters that support your claim.
<p>
The essay could read like a travelogue, vacation brochure, encylcopedia entry,
journal entry, synopsis, or whatever the group decides, but use a consistent voice.

<p>
Here are the results:

Tired of living in a radiation-infested environment? Remember the good old days when an empty apartment was a good thing?
Come to Mars! You and your loved ones can come enjoy the many luxuries Mars has to offer! If you're not in a good mood,
don't worry! We have fabulous Penfield Mood Organs! You'll never have a bad day again. And don't forget the UN gives every
emigrant their own android personally tailored to their needs. Don't stay on Earth, come to Mars, where the only dust is
the good kind and the andys are obedient. Don't be special, come to Mars and be normal!

Looking for a great vacation spot?  Why not San Francisco?  A dust filled hot spot of
Northern California.  The year is now 2021 and this is the "it" spot.  But don’t forget
your lead codpiece.  Although this whimsical dust is fascinating, it’s slightly hazardous
radiation is bearable.  This is the future and we are all used to it.  Don’t forget to
visit the locals and their cheerfully, realistic animals.  And the android population is
near nil.  San Francisco, where all of the last remaining survivors of World War Terminus
are.  So come to San Francisco because you are Special!!

2019 - Day 1: This is my first entry. We found two more owls in our yard today. My sister
and I couldn't help but find it amusing as we threw them away.
<p>
2019 - Day 36: There is a strange dust that has appeared. We thought we would be safe
here, because we were not affected too much by the war. We were wrong. It killed my
sister.
<p>
2019 - Day 48: More people are dead. The news keeps telling people to emigrate to New
America, the colony on Mars. I don't think I will. My parents are afraid, though; they
want to forget.
<p>
2020 - Day 179: The government is now offering new specialized androids to anyone who goes
to one of the colony worlds. I need to leave. It has become too dangerous here. My dog
died. I think that I will buy a new one when I get to New Portland, or at least an
electric one if I can't afford a real one. It’s better than nothing.
<p>
2021 - Day 486: I found out I was special. I couldn't leave. Almost everyone else is gone.
I was able to get an electric dog, though. It keeps the loneliness at bay. I also got a
mood organ. It helps me stay focused. Without it, I would surely die of grief. I am almost
glad that people are gone. I don't know what I would have done if another person called me
a chicken head.
<p>
2021 - Day 512: I lost my job. They say that I am too sick to work. Not even the mood
organ works. I see no point anymore. Goodbye.

In the novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep", written by Philip K. Dick it is
implied that there was a nuclear fall out on Earth, which is called the World War
Terminus.  This is resulted in the world being covered in dust.  It killed millions, and
out of those who remained, most migrated to other planets.  Those who remained on earth
made sure to own at least one animal (electrical or real) because animals were considered
very valuable, due to the endangerment or extinction of most species.
<p>
Rick Deckard, the main character has the job of detecting and eliminating rouge androids
within the surviving community.  He has a wife, Iran and an electric sheep.

In the novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep, by Phillip Dick, a post-apocalyptic
society struggles to live normally. Due to radioactive fallout as a result of a world-war,
much of Earth's population has migrated off-world to avoid poisoning. Those who remain do
so by choice, or are too contaminated to leave.
<p>
To preserve a sense of false-reality, many own android animals. Much like it was before
the warm possessions are a sign of prosperity; the basic trends of culture and society
remain intact, however they are less refined. To combat the negative effects of radiation
on brain chemistry, the wealthy purchase "mood organs" to artificially regulate their
moods.
<P>
The risks of radiation aside, the remaining governments resort to hypocritical propaganda
to encourage the complete assimilation of the human race off the planet. Television
advertisements promise a free android to those who want to leave, so long as they are
neither contaminated nor dim-witted.
<p>
Overall, society is whittled down by factors environmental, economic, and of fear. Those
who remain struggle to preserve what culture has not been forgotten, as well as create a
new one from the bleak, under populated earth no longer fir for a global civilization.

Anything is possible in the world. You can change your present state of mind to your
desired condition by the press of a button. The government screwed up. Bad. Most people
left to Mars. This is due to a great nuclear war that rendered the world desolate and
almost void of animals. So much so in fact that animals are loved and revered and everyone
wants to own one. Androids, or "Andy’s"are horrible and the main character is an assassin
that is trying to destroy them all. Since many have fled to Mars to save themselves, there
is a great amount of property to be inhabited.

<ul>
<LI> There was a war called World War Terminus (WWT) which entailed radioactive dust.  This may be Cold War symbolism.
<LI> Normal people emigrated to Mars.  Those that stayed behind started forming a class hierarchy.
<LI> A device was used to dial moods.  It seems that this device was only available for the middle and upper class.
<LI> Andys are androids.  Rick is employed by the government as a bounty hunter who destroys Andys.
<LI> Androids are used as servants were and given to those who emigrated.
<LI> Electrical animals are inferior to biological animals.  Rick's biological sheep died in WWT so he replaced it with an electrical sheep.
<LI> It was illegal to not care about animals after WWT.
