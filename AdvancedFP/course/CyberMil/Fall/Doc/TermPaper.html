<H3>Possible Topic #1:  Novel to Film comparison</H3>
<p>

In class we have studied and discussed a seminal example the cyberpunk literary genre, <U>Do
Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</U> We have also watched and discussed the 1982 (2007) film
<U>Blade Runner</U> based on the novel. Discuss a point of comparison between the two texts,
some symbol or idea. How is this symbol or idea portrayed differently in the two mediums? I
suggest you pick a pivotal scene in the film in which a particular idea is played out and
compare it to a specific passage in the novel. I would like you to make your own observations
and not rely on the work of "authorities" (critics). If you do choose to consult critics or
authorities please do so AFTER you have made your choice based on the criteria in our
discussions and after you have attempted to examine both texts on your own (i.e. don't read
any critics until after part 2 of the assignment is done). I am interested in your opinions
not the opinions of some critic! Of course you may draw on the work of any critic with whom
you want to put yourself into a dialog. (see Ways of Writing p. 42 ff)

<p>

<H3>Possible Topic #2: What is the relationship between humans and technology in Blade Runner.</H3>
<p>
How does the film portray the relationship of humans to technology? What role does technology play
in the human society depicted in this film? Is it menacing? utopian? ever-changing? What does this
film say about what it means to be human?
<p>
When writing your paper you should consider the following:
<ul>
<li>	Are there particular symbols or ideas you find compelling and interesting? What are they?
<li>	What scenes and images in particular lend themselves to your "reading" of this film?
<li>	What specific evidence is there for your point of view?
</ul>
<p>

<H3>Structure</H3>
<p>

A successful paper will have a strong thesis statement supported by a detailed analysis of a
few scenes or images that support your ideas. It will also incorporate the thoughts of others
by the use of quotes and a bibliography.

<p>

<H3>Help</H3>
<p>

<STRONG>Writing Center: </STRONG> I strongly recommend making at least one appointment with the writing center
NOW. It is best to meet with them when you have a clearly defined topic and at least some
preliminary writing. If you wait until the end of the term you will not get an appointment.
It would be appropriate to have three or more appointments if writing is a challenge for you.
Even someone who already writes well can benefit from an expert opinion.

<p>

<STRONG>Library: </STRONG> Don’t be shy about asking for help in the library. Our library contact for Cyber
Millenium is Micheal Bowman. He will be the most familiar with what we are doing. But any of
the librarians are happy to help with questions, so if Michael is not available just ask at the
desk. Also see the <A HREF="http://www.lib.pdx.edu/instruction/survivalguide/index.htm">Research Survival Guide</A>.

<H2>Part 1 - Bibliography</H2>

Assembling a Bibliography. You are to go to the library and find 5
items that you will use in your term paper. <STRONG>You must bring these
five item to class</STRONG> on Monday, Nov 10th. They will be the basis
of an in class activity.
<p>
You must include at least one book, and at least one peer reviewed
journal article. It might include another film or cyber punk novel, film or book reviews,
articles about the cyber punk genre, articles about artifical intelligence, etc.

<p>

When you find the books keep good records, because you must also
create a bibliography. I.e. a written a list of the books. It includes
the necessary information that other people could use to find the same item.
This includes title, author, dates, pages etc. In our class we will use the <A
HREF="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/557/01/">MLA bibliography
style</A>. If you follow the link, there is an online resource you can use to learn
how to construct such a bibliography. The sections on "works cited" are particularly
useful. Use them as your guide.
<p>
I have created some <A HREF="AnnotatedBibliography.html">notes on how to make an annotated bibliography</A>. Please look at
them and follow the suggestions.
