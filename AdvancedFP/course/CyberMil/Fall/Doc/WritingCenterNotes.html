<LI> The website is up and running at <A HREF="writingcenter.pdx.edu">writingcenter.pdx.edu</A>.
The site
features a step-by-step writing resource guide for students working on
college writing assignments. <br><br>


<LI> WR199 is a one-credit course available to FRINQ students.  Each student
enrolled meets for an hour each week with an assigned tutor to work on
FRINQ writing assignments.  Students should come in and ask for Dan
DeWeese, the WC Coordinator, to register. <br><br>

<LI> There is a blog about writing for university studies. You
can read it at
<A HREF="www.univstudieswriting.blogspot.com">www.univstudieswriting.blogspot.com</A>.  Look for new posts soon.  Add your
comments to old posts at any time. <br><br>

<LI> FRINQ Writing Clinic: Fridays from 12 - 1 in the Wrting Center projects room.
Bring any questions, issues, or
ideas about writing. <br><br>

<LI>Daneen Bergland, FRINQ Faculty Writing Consultant, will be in the Writing Center and
available to students and mentors  on Fridays from 9 - 3:30. <br><br>

<LI> The writing center will have an outpost in the library 9:00 - 1:00 weekdays. It's
conveniently located on the second floor of the library with a librarian also available
for full service paper researching to complement the expert writing advice.
Now that food an drink are permitted in the library, why would students go anywhere else?
