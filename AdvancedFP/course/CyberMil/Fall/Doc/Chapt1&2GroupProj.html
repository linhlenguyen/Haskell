<H2>Group Assignment</H2>
<p>
In the next 20 minutes you are to form groups of 4 people.
Each group is given two tasks (See below: Background and Symbolism).

<ol>
<li> Form qiuckly and quietly into groups of 4.
<li> Organize your groups. Choose leaders, notetakers, etc.
<li> Decide how you will use a division of labor
<li> Decide what "product" you will produce
<li> Decide who will be your group's spokes person
<li> get to work
</ol>


<p>
<H2>Background</H2>
<p>
When an author writes a novel or play, he often uses the first few
chapters to set the scene. This is true about Philip K. Dick's novel
"Do Androids dream of electric sheep".
<p>
By reading between the lines, speculate about the world in which the novel
takes place. THe following are example things you may address, but
you may create your own list.
<p>
<OL>
<LI> What important things happened in the past that led to this world?
<LI> What are the important customs?
<LI> What role does the government play?
<li> Who are the good guys? the bad guys?
<LI> What role does religion play? what role does technology play?
<LI> What other important things does the author hint at in the first two chapters?
</OL>
<p>
In each group, write a 100-250 word essay about the "Do Androids ..." world.
The goal is to speculate about concrete details that are only hinted
at in the first two chapters. Nothing is too bizarre, as long as you can
point to evidence in the first two chapters that support your claim.
<p>
The essay could read like a travelogue, vacation brochure, encylcopedia entry,
journal entry, synopsis, or whatever the group decides, but use a consistent voice.

<p>
<H2>Symbolism</H2>
<p>
Symbolism, in literature, is the use of an ordinary thing or object
to stand for another more important concept.
<p>
Authors often invoke symbolism to set the mood for novel or play. This often is
especially true in the first few chapters of a book, or the first few scenes in a play.
<p>
By carefully analyzing what you read in the first two chapters, make a list of possible
symbolic images. Each item in the list should include the
"ordinary item" and the concept it is symbolic of.
