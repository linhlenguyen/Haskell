This assignment is to implement 2-3 Trees in Omega using Omega';s type
system to enforce the invariants of 2-3 trees.
<p>
See the following set of <A HREF="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/cs14/cs14_06win/slides/2-3_trees_covered.pdf">slides</A> about 2-3 Trees I found on the web
as an introduction.
<p>
2-3 Trees have the follwoing invariants (taken from <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-3_tree">wikipedia</A> with some of my own improvements).
<ol>

<li> Every non-leaf is a 2-node or a 3-node. A 2-node contains one data item and
    has two children. A 3-node contains two data items and has 3 children.
<li> All leaves are at the same level (the bottom level). This means the distance from a leaf to the root
is the same for all leaf nodes.
<li> All data is kept in sorted order.
<li> Leaf node will contain 1 or 2 data fields.
</ol>
<p>
Here is a picture of a 2-3 tree.

<p>
As homework do the following
<ol>
<li> Define an Omega generalized algebraic datatype to encode 2-3-Trees.
<li> Use type indexes to encode as many of the invariants as you can.
(You may leave out the sorted order invariant if you desire, but even this one is possible).
<li> Write an insert function that inserts an element and maintains the
index invaraints, thus maintaining the balance invariant of the tree.
</ol>
